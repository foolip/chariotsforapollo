Birds, reptiles, and animals of higher and lower order that gathered at
the Florida Wildlife Game Refuge (also known by the aliases of Merritt
Island Launch Annex and Kennedy Space Center) at 7:00 in the morning of
9 November 1967 received a tremendous jolt. When the five engines in the
first stage of the Saturn V ignited, there was a man-made earthquake and
shockwave. As someone later remarked, the question was not whether the
Saturn V had risen, but whether Florida had sunk.

<cite>The spacecraft stack at Launch Complex 39 is poised for the first
Saturn V mission and first use of LC 39. The umbilical tower on the
launch pad to the left of the spacecraft feeds fuel and electricity to
the launch vehicle-spacecraft combination. The mobile service structure
to the right may be moved to enclose the spacecraft with an
office-workshop compartment and other work levels.</cite>

Apollo-Saturn mission 501, now officially <cite>Apollo 4</cite> - the
first all-up test of the three-stage Saturn V - was on its way. On its
top rested spacecraft 017, a Block I model with many Block II features,
such as an improved heatshield and a new hatch. The aim of the mission,
in addition to testing the structural integrity and compatibility of the
spacecraft-launch vehicle combination, was to boost the command and
service modules into an elliptical orbit and then power-dive the command
module (in an area over Hawaii) into the atmosphere as though it were
returning from the moon to the earth. Apollo 4 also carried a mockup of
the lunar module. Weighing more than 2.7 million kilograms when fully
fueled with liquid oxygen and a kerosene mixture called RP-1, the Saturn
V first stage generated 7.5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff.<a href
= "#source44"><b>44</b></a> The flight went almost exactly as planned,
and the huge booster rammed its payload into a parking orbit 185
kilometers above the earth. After two revolutions, the S-IVB third stage
propelled the spacecraft outward to more than 17,000 kilometers, where
it cut loose from the S-IVB and started falling earthward. Then the
service module fired, to send the spacecraft out to 18,000 kilometers
for a four-and-a-half-hour soak in the supercold and hot radiation of
space. Telemetry signals noted no degradation in cabin environment. With
the spacecraft nose pointed toward the earth, the service module engine
fired again. When the spacecraft reached the 122,000-meter atmospheric
reentry zone, it was blunt-end forward and traveling at a speed of
40,000 kilometers per hour.<p>

Seamen on the U.S.S. <cite>Bennington</cite> the prime recovery ship in
the Pacific, watched the descending spacecraft, with its parachutes in
full bloom, until it landed 16 kilometers away about nine hours after
its launch from Florida. Swimmers jumped from helicopters to assist in
the recovery of spacecraft 017, which took about two hours. Technically,
managerially, and psychologically, <cite>Apollo 4</cite> was an
important and successful mission, especially in view of the number of
firsts it tackled. It was the first flight of the first and second
stages of the Saturn V (the S-IVB stage had flown on the Saturn IB
launch vehicles), the first launch of the complete Saturn V, the first
restart of the S-IVB in orbital flight, the first liftoff from Complex
39, the first flight test of the Block II command module heatshield, the
first flight of even a simulated lunar module, and so on. The fact that
everything worked so well and with so little trouble gave NASA a
confident feeling, as Phillips phrased it, that &quot;Apollo [was] on
the way to the moon.&quot;<a href = "#source45"><b>45</b></a><p>

Even before spacecraft 017 had set out on its trip, the Manned
Spacecraft Center was working hard on how to get Apollo to the moon
before 1970 - only a little more than two years away. On 20 September,
Low and others met with top manned space flight officials in Washington
to present the center's plan, the key features of which were the need
for additional lander and Saturn V development flights and the
incorporation of a lunar orbital flight into the schedule. Owen Maynard
presented plans for scheduling seven types of missions that would lead
step by step to the ultimate goal. He described these steps,
&quot;A&quot; through &quot;G,&quot; with G as the lunar landing
mission.<p>

Phillips asked that the group consider carefully both the pros and cons
of flying an additional Saturn V flight. Wernher von Braun and Low
favored the flight - von Braun, because he felt the launch operations
people would need the experience, and Low, because he believed that data
from several flights would be needed to make certain that the big
booster was indeed ready for its flight to the moon. Against these
opinions, Phillips cited the tremendous workload an added flight would
place on the preflight crews at Kennedy, and Mueller reminded the
meeting of the already crowded launch schedule for 1968. An additional
lunar module mission would be flown only if LM-1 were unsuccessful.<p>

Most discussion centered on the insertion of a lunar orbital flight into
the schedule. Houston wanted &quot;to evaluate the deep space
environment and to develop procedures for the entire lunar landing
mission short of LM descent, ascent and surface operations.&quot;
Mueller remarked that he regarded the lunar orbit mission as just as
hazardous as the landing mission. But the Texas group argued that they
had no intention of flying the vehicle closer to the moon than 15,000
meters. They pointed out that the crew would not have to train for the
actual landing, but it would give them a chance to develop the
procedures for getting into lunar orbit and undocking and for the
rendezvous that the lunar landing crew would need. Mueller said,
&quot;Apollo should not go to the moon to develop procedures.&quot; Low
reminded him that crew operations would not be the main reason for the
trip; there was still a lot to be learned about communications,
navigation, and thermal control in the deep space environment.<a href =
"#source46"><b>46</b></a> Although a final decision on the lunar orbital
mission was not made until later, Maynard's seven-step plan was
generally adopted throughout NASA.<p>

Plenty of wrinkles remained to be ironed out, but by the end of 1967
Apollo seemed to be rounding the corner toward its ultimate goal,
despite the most tragic event that manned space flight had so far
encountered.
