<h2>1959 to Mid-1962</h2>

<p>

Politically setting a goal of manned lunar landing during the 1960s
meant little technologically until somebody decided on the best way to
fly there and back. Numerous suggestions had been made as to how to make
the trip. Some sounded logical, some read like science fiction, and each
proposal had vocal and persistent champions. All had been listened to
with interest, but with no compelling need to choose among them. When
President Kennedy introduced a deadline, however, it was time to pick
one of the two basic mission modes - direct ascent or rendezvous - and,
further, one of the variations of that mode. The story of Apollo told
here thus far has only touched on the technical issues encountered along
the tangled path to selecting the route.
