<h1>The Outlook</h1>

<p>

At midyear 1968, chances for landing on the moon within the decade were
still touch-and-go. It did seem likely that NASA would have to fly only
five, instead of six, preparatory flights that year, but one of these
might have to be another unmanned Saturn V. Not knowing exactly what
would follow the third mission of the year (a manned Saturn IB launch)
caused some extra planning. For example, the Kennedy spacecraft
preparation team had to prepare both a boilerplate and a qualified
production command module for the next Saturn V shot, since the choice
for launch depended on the outcome of the pogo investigations. Mission
planners in Washington also revived the plan for launching two Saturn IB
missions to give both the North American and the Grumman spacecraft a
workout in earth orbit, if another unmanned Saturn V had to be flown.<a

as the delivery date for LM-3 was still not firm.<p>

On the brighter side of the ledger at mid-year was North American's work
in getting CSM-101 ready for the first manned Apollo mission. Although
the contractor was late in shipping the craft from its California
factory to the Florida launch site, improvements in the fabrication of
this machine indicated that future spacecraft should be on time. After a
traumatic and pressure-packed 18 months, North American was finally
delivering satisfactory, flight-ready hardware. When 101 arrived at the
Cape on 30 May, the receiving inspectors found fewer discrepancies than
on any spacecraft previously delivered to Kennedy.<a href =

Mueller had told the Senate space committee in February 1968 that the
first manned Apollo mission would be flown in the last quarter of the
year.<a href = "#source47"><b>47</b></a> In June, this still seemed
feasible.
