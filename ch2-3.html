<h2>Spacecraft Development Decision</h2>

<p>

This sudden preoccupation in NASA's highest echelons with the mode of
flying to the moon put the spacecraft development planners in a
quandary. Space Task Group engineers had the contractors' feasibility
study reports in hand and had used them and their own studies in
drafting specifications for a spacecraft hardware contract. The major
question was whether they would have to wait until all the pieces in the
Apollo stack were defined before awarding the contract. Robert Gilruth
went to Washington on 2 June to find out.<p>

During a meeting with Abe Silverstein and his Space Flight Programs
staff, a consensus developed on the six areas in which major contracts
would be needed: (1) launch vehicles; (2) the spacecraft command center,
which would double as the return vehicle; (3) the propulsion module,
with extra duty as the lunar takeoff section; (4) the lunar landing
stage, which would be both a braking rocket and a lunar launch pad; (5)
the communications and tracking network; and (6) the earth launch
facilities.<a href = "#source4">4</a> To get these projects under way,
Silverstein said, Seamans had approved letting the spacecraft
development contract.<a href = "#source5">5</a><p>

Gilruth took this good news back to Virginia, but he and his men still
had a question. What would industry be bidding on? The Space Task Group
favored a modified Mercury capsule (a bell shape extended into a conical
pyramid) and had worked on that design. Its chief competitor was a
lifting-body design, with trims and flaps, championed by Alfred Eggers
and his colleagues at the Ames Research Center.<p>

&quot;Apollo-Control Capsule.&quot; The command module with airlock
retracted is at the center, the bathing compartment sketched below it.
At left center, a crewman in the extended airlock removes the hatch. At
upper and lower right, legs of the third takeoff and reentry seat,
rigged in the companionway, are folded away for flight and moved back
into place for landing. At upper left, parachutes begin to deploy after
rocket jettison for reentry.</cite>

Max Faget, leading spacecraft designer at the Space Task Group, later
said that one of his major objectives was to make the Apollo command
module big enough; they were just finding out all the problems caused by
a too-small Mercury capsule. He set the diameter at the base of the
Apollo craft at 4.3 meters, as opposed to Mercury's 1.8 meters. When
Faget asked Wernher von Braun, at Marshall, to fly some models of the
craft, there was a problem. Since early Saturn vehicles did not have a
payload, Marshall had used spare Jupiter missile nose cones on the first
test flights. Douglas Aircraft Company had resized the Saturn's S-IV
stage to fit the Jupiter body, which was smaller than the Apollo command
module. Marshall contended that enlarging the S-IV would cost millions
of dollars, and Space Task Group did not argue the point. Until this
time, the design concept for the Apollo heatshield had called for a
sharp rim, as in Mercury, which increased the total drag and gave more
lifting capability. Rather than decrease the interior volume, Faget's
design team simply rounded the edge to match the S-IV.<p>

The command module's rounded edges simplified another design decision.
Faget wanted to use beryllium shingles on the afterbody, as he had in
Mercury, to take care of reentry heating, but Langley engineers believed
the spaceship would be traveling too fast for shingles to handle the
heat. The design group decided to wrap an ablative heatshield around the
whole command module. This wraparound shield had another advantage. One
of the big questions about outer space was radiation exposure. James Van
Allen, discoverer of the radiation belts surrounding the earth and named
for him, had predicted exposure would be severe. Encapsulating the space
vehicle with ablative material as an additional guard against radiation,
even though it entailed a large weight penalty, was a big selling point
for the heatshield.<a href = "#source6">6</a><p>

Space Task Group engineers were satisfied with their design, although
none too sure that anyone else in NASA liked it. George Low, however,
found merit in both the blunt- and lifting-body configurations and
suggested to Silverstein that two prime spacecraft contractors be hired,
each to work from a different set of specifications.<a href =
"#source7">7</a><p>

Space Task Group engineers wanted no part of this dual approach. In
early July, Caldwell Johnson summarized for Gilruth their reasons for
insisting on the blunt-body shape. Johnson emphasized mainly the
operational advantages and the experience gained from Mercury that would
accrue to Apollo. He confined his discussion to the trip to the moon and
back, making no mention of landing the craft on its surface.<a href =
"#source8">8</a> Those most concerned with the command module's basic
configuration were still looking at the problems connected with
circumlunar flight: a vehicle that could fly around the moon and back to
earth, sustain three men for two weeks, and reenter the atmosphere at
much higher speeds than from earth orbit.<p>

Gilruth's Apollo planners pressed on, drawing up a hardware development
contract for their chosen craft. This vehicle could be adapted for a
lunar landing later, but that problem was shunted to the background for
the time being. Jack Heberlig, a member of Faget's design team for the
Mercury capsule, drafted the hardware guidelines for the Apollo command
center spacecraft. While Heberlig's procurement plan was in final review
at NASA Headquarters the first week in July, Robert Piland and John
Disher were setting up a technical conference to apprise potential
contractors of NASA's requirements. Invitations were sent to 1,200
representatives from industry and 160 from government agencies.<a href =
"#source9">9</a><p>

From 18 to 20 July 1961, more than 1,000 persons (representing 300
companies, the White House staff, Congress, and other governmental
departments) attended a NASA-Industry Apollo Technical Conference in
Washington. The first day, NASA engineers talked about space vehicle
design, mission profiles, and navigation, guidance, and control. On the
second day, the attendees heard papers on space environment, entry
heating and thermal protection, and onboard systems. During these
sessions, the Space Task Group speakers pushed their blunt-body shape.<a
href = "#source10">10</a><p>

Gilruth's men never doubted that the keystone to Apollo was the
spacecraft itself. As they waited for higher authority to act, they
continued to plan with Marshall a series of tests using a blunt-body
capsule.<a href = "#source11">11</a> By the end of July, Administrator
Webb had approved the procurement plan, and Glenn Bailey, Gilruth's
contracting officer, had mailed out the requests for proposals.<a href =
"#source12">12</a><p>

While waiting for the companies to respond, NASA awarded its first
hardware contract for Apollo. After spending six months on a feasibility
study, the Instrumentation Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) received a contract on 9 August to develop the guidance
and navigation system.<a href = "#source13">13</a>
