<h2>1968: First Half</h2>

<p>

NASA officials faced 1968 with some satisfaction and a little
trepidation. <cite>Apollo 4</cite> the previous November had been a
triumph, but the Apollo team might have to do just as well six times in
1968 and five in 1969. That string of successes seemed to be a necessary
prelude to a timely lunar landing.<a href = "#source1"><b>1</b></a>
Against this backdrop of mounting schedule pressures, a spate of
technical problems cropped up. The most worrisome were those connected
with the lunar module. It had grown too fat again and still had problems
with metal cracking and with the ascent engine during test firings.
Combined, these faults played havoc with delivery schedules and posed a
definite threat to achieving Apollo's mission within the decade.<p>

The command module also had some unresolved worries, although North
American had made good progress in its redefinition and qualification.
Flammability testing and the question of cabin atmosphere on the pad and
at launch carried over into the new year, as did the difficulties in
getting systems to the spacecraft production line at Downey.<a href =
