<h2>Preparations for the First Manned Apollo Mission</h2>

<p>

For a time, the mission called AS-204 had two flight plans. AS-204A,
manned by Gus Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee,<a href =
"#explanation1"><b>*</b></a> was &quot;to verify spacecraft crew
operations and CSM subsystems performance for an earth-orbit mission of
up to 14 days' duration and to verify the launch vehicle subsystems
performance in preparation for subsequent operational Saturn IB
missions.&quot; The flight would be in the last quarter of 1966 from
Launch Complex 34 at Cape Kennedy. AS-204B, on the other hand, would be
an unmanned mission with the same objectives (except for crew
operations), to be flown only if spacecraft and launch vehicle had not
qualified for manned flights. And there were doubts. Gas ingestion in
the service module propulsion system in AS-201 and the resulting erratic
firing had caused some misgivings, although these had been somewhat
allayed by AS-202.<a href = "#source50"><b>50</b></a><p>

As in early Mercury and Gemini manned flights, stress was laid on
engineering and operational qualification rather than on experiments -
whether medical or scientific. In December 1966, with only 9 experiments
assigned to AS-204, 30 operational functions had a higher priority. And
even then Slayton complained that the crew was not getting enough time
in the new simulation and checkout facilities because of the
experiments. Despite his arguments, the second Apollo crew (Walter
Schirra, Donn Eisele, and Walter Cunningham, with Frank Borman,
Stafford, and Collins as backups), announced on 29 September, was
scheduled for a heavier workload of experiments.<a href =
"#source51"><b>51</b></a> As technical troubles came to the fore,
however, emphasis on experiments shifted.

North American should have shipped spacecraft 012 from Downey to Kennedy
in early August, but &quot;eleventh hour problems associated with the
Command Module Environmental Control Unit water glycol pump failure
resulted in a NAA NASA decision to replace the ECU with the unit from SC
014.&quot; The Customer Acceptance Review revealed some environmental
control items that still needed to be corrected, but NASA allowed North
American to ship 012 to Florida on 25 August anyway. Once it arrived,
John G. Shinkle, Apollo Program Manager at Kennedy, complained about the
amount of engineering work that still had to be done. More than half of
it, he said, should have been finished before the spacecraft left the
factory.<a href = "#source52"><b>52</b></a><p>

While flight-preparation crews were having problems, Grissom, White, and
Chaffee were finding bottlenecks in training activities. The chief
problem was keeping the Apollo mission simulator current with changes
being made in spacecraft 012. At the Cape, Riley D. McCafferty said,
there were more than 100 modifications outstanding at one time. Grissom,
McCafferty later recalled, would &quot;tear my heart out&quot; because
the simulator was not keeping up with the spacecraft. Eventually, the
first Apollo commander hung a lemon on the trainer.<a href =
"#source53"><b>53</b></a><p>

Getting the spacecraft to the Cape did not really improve conditions.
The environmental control unit needed to be replaced again, which held
up testing in the vacuum chamber. AiResearch shipped the new unit from
its West Coast plant to Kennedy on 2 November. Within two weeks, it was
installed and testing was begun. It was then returned to California for
further work. By mid-December, the component was back in Florida and in
the spacecraft. Meanwhile, the service module had been waiting in the
vacuum chamber for the command module. While it was sitting there, a
light shattered, and falling debris damaged several of the maneuvering
thrusters.<a href = "#source54"><b>54</b></a> But this was not the only
cause for worry about the service module.<p>

On 25 October at the North American factory, the service module for
spacecraft 017 was undergoing routine pressure tests of the propulsion
system's propellant tanks when the tanks suddenly exploded. No one was
injured, but North American and NASA engineers were baffled as to the
cause for the next few weeks. The tanks had not been overpressurized,
test procedures had not been relaxed, and no design deficiencies were
apparent; yet the fuel storage tank had failed with a bang. Since the
service module for spacecraft 012 had been through identical tests, Shea
was vitally concerned with unraveling this riddle before Grissom and his
group flew.<p>

William M. Bland and Joseph N. Kotanchik were sent from the Manned
Spacecraft Center to Downey to help North American hunt for the trouble,
and Houston set up a parallel test to verify the results. They learned
that the methanol (methyl alcohol) employed as a test pressurant fluid
caused stress corrosion (or cracking) of the titanium alloy used for the
propellant tanks. Replacing the methanol with a fluid that was
compatible with titanium would eliminate this problem. In the meantime,
the tanks were removed from service module 012 and found to be free of
any dangerous corrosion.<a href = "#source55"><b>55</b></a><p>

In September, Mueller reminded Gilruth of the upcoming Design
Certification Review. Board membership would, he said, include himself,
Gilruth, von Braun, and Debus. The group met on 7 October and agreed
that the space vehicle conformed to design requirements and was
flightworthy, provided several deficiencies were corrected. Phillips
sent the list to Lee B. James at Marshall, Shinkle at Kennedy, and Shea
at the Manned Spacecraft Center, urging speedy clearance. Shinkle had
already registered his complaints about spacecraft 012; now he added
that Houston should insist on better spacecraft being shipped to the
Cape. He pointed out the major problems that had been found: a leak in
the service propulsion system, problems with the reaction control
system, troubles in the environmental control unit, and even design
deficiencies in the crew couches that required North American engineers
to travel from Downey to the Cape to correct them.<a href =
"#source56"><b>56</b></a><p>

In early December, NASA reluctantly surrendered its plans for launching
the first manned Apollo flight before the end of 1966. Mueller and
Seamans then reshuffled the flight schedule, delaying AS-204 until
February 1967 and scrubbing the scheduled second mission. Experimenters
who had planned to place their wares aboard Schirra's spacecraft were
brushed aside. Following AS-204, NASA planned to fly the lunar module
alone and then a manned Block II command and service module, No. 101, in
August 1967 to rendezvous with unmanned LM-2, the LM being lofted into
orbit by a Saturn IB in a mission dubbed AS-205/208.<p>

If everything went well, NASA hoped to get two crews besides Grissom's
spaceborne before the end of 1967, with at least one riding a Saturn V.
Replacing the Schirra team as the second Apollo flight crew were James
McDivitt, David Scott, and Russell Schweickart (backed by Thomas
Stafford, John Young, and Eugene Cernan) for a workout of the command
module and lander in earth orbit. To fly the Saturn V mission, AS-503,
NASA picked Frank Borman, Michael Collins, and William Anders (with
Charles Conrad, Richard Gordon, and Clifton Williams as backups); they
would ride the spacecraft into orbit and out as far as 6,400 kilometers
above the earth.<a href = "#source57"><b>57</b></a><p>

After all this flight shuffling, the Apollo program seemed to be in fair
shape at the end of 1966. North American had finished the last of the
manufacturing work on the earth-orbital version of the command and
service modules on 16 September and could now concentrate on improving
the lunar-orbital spacecraft.<a href = "#source58"><b>58</b></a> The
lunar module still had problems, but Grumman was making headway in
resolving them. The pathway to the moon appeared to be clearing, as NASA
stood on the threshold of Apollo manned space flight operations.
