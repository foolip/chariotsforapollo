<h1>Program Direction and the Command Module</h1>

<p>

Administrator James Webb knew that the futures of NASA and Apollo were
interlocked and that the agency's peak in appropriations and manpower
would probably be reached in 1965 and 1966. But neither he nor the other
NASA officials who spent six months each year justifying financial needs
before the Bureau of the Budget and Congress could predict just when
funding requirements would taper off. On one hand, only $5.1 billion of
the $5.25 billion authorized for fiscal 1965 had been spent; on the
other, there were indications that the $5.2 billion in the fiscal year
1966 authorization might not be enough. Apollo funding was more than
$2.5 billion in 1965 and would exceed $3 billion in each of the next few
years. The spacecraft alone accounted for a third of this, $1 billion a
year.<a href = "#source1"><b>1</a></b><p>

Almost as soon as he joined NASA, Associate Administrator for Manned
Space Flight George Mueller had argued before Congress, the budget
bureau, and his superiors that cost and schedule factors were
intertwined: slowing the pace - and many asked, why the hurry? - meant
stretching both time and payrolls. To hold costs down, Mueller believed
in pushing, although not sacrificing, performance, reliability, and
quality, continually admonishing his field centers to &quot;get today's
work done today - and some of tomorrow's work also.&quot; But the drive
for order needed more than Mueller's prompting. On 15 January 1965,
Apollo Program Director Samuel Phillips issued an &quot;Apollo Program
Development Plan.&quot; Besides serving as a general reference, this
document, in its 17 subdivisions, specified how the Apollo objectives
would be reached, how performance and proposed changes would be
evaluated, and how these changes, after approval, would be implemented.
Its first section, Program Management, laid out the responsibilities for
all participants in a pie-shaped chart, sliced to show each major piece
of the program and the organization - industry or NASA (MSC, Marshall,
Goddard, Kennedy, or Headquarters) - assigned to implement these duties.
Other sections dealt with such items as scheduling, procurement, data
management, configuration management, logistics, facilities, funds and
manpower, and systems engineering. This directive pulled together, in
one place, all the parts of Apollo and explained how the decisions to
integrate them would be made.<a href = "#source2"><b>2</a></b><p>

Mueller had revived the dormant Panel Review Board in late 1964,<a href
= "#explanation1"><b>*</b></a> hoping to get a tighter rein on
configuration control management of the spacecraft and launch vehicles
and to speed up the manufacture and qualification of flight vehicles.
Houston had established a Configuration Control Panel in 1963, but
spacecraft development was in such a fluid state that panel authority
was limited. By late 1964, however, ASPO Manager Joseph Shea was able to
set up a stronger, more effective, Configuration Control Board to review
and manage changes in the spacecraft.<a href =
"#source3"><b>3</a></b><p>

After much correspondence between Washington and Houston, Shea issued a
Configuration Management Plan, outlining his board's responsibilities
and limitations and the functions of each of the program offices under
his jurisdiction in carrying out the dictates of the board. But having a
plan did not immediately turn the tide. Even after the document was
published, Shea and his lieutenants tried in vain to stem mounting
weights and slipping schedules. During a briefing at North American in
April, Shea felt, as he had earlier, that engineering was getting out of
hand and slowing progress on both Block I (earth-orbital) and Block II
(lunar-orbital) command modules. Block I spacecraft 004 and 007 would be
three and six weeks late leaving the factory, and North American had
completed only 526 of nearly 4,000 engineering drawings for Block II.
Dale D. Myers, NAA Apollo Program Director in Downey, assured Shea that
the company was beginning to catch up on its workload. Nevertheless,
Myers reorganized his engineering department into six divisions
reporting to his chief engineer, H. Gary Osbon: systems engineering
(under Norman J. Ryker, Jr.), project engineering (Ray W. Pyle), vehicle
systems (J. J. Williams), control systems (S. M. Treman), ground support
equipment (D. K. Bailey), and planning and operations (C. V. Mills).<a
href = "#source4"><b>4</a></b><p>

Configuration control was a major factor in bringing order to Apollo,
but there had to be some way to gauge how well it worked. In mid-August,
Mueller and Phillips identified a series of reviews, inspections, and
certifications that would be key checkpoints for Apollo:<p>

<ol>
<li>Preliminary Design Review (PDR) - to review the basic design during
the detailed design phase;

<li>Critical Design Review (CDR) - to check specifications and
engineering drawings before their release for manufacture;

<li>Flight Article Configuration Inspection (FACI) - to compare hardware
with specifications and drawings and to validate acceptance testing
(FACI could be repeated to make sure that any deficiencies had been
corrected; it would also be repeated on every vehicle that departed
significantly from the basic design);

<li>Certification of Flight Worthiness (COFW) - to certify completion
and flight-qualification of each vehicle stage or spacecraft module;

<li>Design Certification Review (DCR)<a href =
"#explanation2"><b>**</b></a> - to verify the airworthiness and safety
of each spacecraft and launch vehicle design (DCRs would include all
government and contractor agencies with major parts of the programs and
would formally review the development and qualification of all stages,
modules, and subsystems);

<li>Flight Readiness Review (FRR) - a two-part review before each
flight, held by the mission director in Washington, to confirm the
readiness of hardware and facilities (the mission period would then
begin with the commitment of support forces around the world).</ol>

These six checkpoints charted the course for the step-by-step flow of
hardware from drawing board and shop floor to flight-ready vehicles at
the launch site.<a href = "#source5"><b>5</a></b><p>

While Headquarters was working on configuration control and the review
plans, command module weight kept getting out of hand. Caldwell Johnson
reminded Max Faget in August that, more than a year and a half earlier,
he had pointed to weight control as the single most difficult technical
problem. To &quot;keep [the] spacecraft on its diet,&quot; Johnson
proposed putting pressure on the subsystem managers to begin a rigorous
system of checks and cross-checks down through the subsystem level.
Faget passed Johnson's suggestions along to Shea, who, already aware
that he had a fat spacecraft, was also being bombarded with warnings
about the lack of reliability in Block I. Owen G. Morris, Shea's Chief
of Reliability and Quality Assurance, listed 71 possible failure points
that North American had evidently done nothing to eliminate. Morris was
not the only one to raise the reliability issue. Shea's old adversary in
the mode selection, Nicholas Golovin of the President's Science Advisory
Committee, wrote that he had heard of 50 items that accounted for
&quot;perhaps 95 percent of the unreliability of the Apollo
system.&quot;<a href = "#source6"><b>6</a></b>

Not all the story was bleak, however. In November attention centered on
a three-week Critical Design Review for the Block II command module.
This event followed reviews of the lower equipment bay and upper deck in
February; the guidance and control systems, crew compartment, and
docking system in March; the extravehicular mobility unit in April;
internal lighting displays and side access hatch in June; and the
spacecraft-lunar module adapter in June and August. The major result of
all these reviews was an entirely new inspection article called, in
engineering shorthand, &quot;EM<sup>3</sup>&quot; (for engineering
manufacturing module mockup), which demonstrated that North American was
making progress toward a finished Block II design.<p>

Alan Kehlet, North American's Block II project manager, and assistants
Gerald R. Fagan and Louis W. Walkover made the contractor's
presentation. Kehlet explained that the Critical Design Review was a
formal, technical review of the Block II spacecraft as reflected in the
program specification. The general format of the briefing was:
&quot;This is what the spec says it's supposed to look like or supposed
to do from a functional standpoint, and this is what the design
is.&quot;<p>

Before Fagan and Walkover launched into discussions of each individual
system, Kehlet told his listeners that NASA must shoulder some of the
blame for schedule slips at North American:<p>

<blockquote>This is the status of our vehicles in manufacturing. . . .
You can see we are about four weeks behind in 2TV-1 [the Block II
thermal-vacuum test article] and primarily [because of a] lack of
secondary bond details. . . . The reason we're having trouble with
secondary bond details is [that] we are having trouble defining the wire
routing in certain areas. The reason we're having trouble with defining
the wire routing is because the schematics came out late. And the reason
schematics came out late was somebody didn't define their system. And
NASA and the [North American] project office get blamed for that. So
it's a chain event. . . .<a href =
"#source7"><b>7</b></a></blockquote><p>

For several months, Shea had been critical of Block II progress. He had
complained in June that engineers, besides trying to develop the
spacecraft, had adopted a stance of &quot;as long as we are making the
necessary changes, we might as well introduce these [others].&quot;
Therefore he asked the subsystem managers in Houston and Downey, who
were causing some of the problems, to review both Blocks I and II and
eliminate any unnecessary changes. There were plenty of subsystem or
component problems to wrestle with, Shea knew, without constantly
redesigning the lower equipment bay to fit changing components. In all
fairness, however - and Shea knew this - the subsystem managers at North
American and the Manned Spacecraft Center were caught in the trap of
changing concepts. For example, the cancellation of onboard maintenance
in favor of redundant or backup systems in the event of a malfunction
resulted in modified parts and subsystems that would no longer fit in
the equipment section.<a href = "#source8"><b>8</a></b><p>

But sometimes a change was dictated by troubles that cropped up in
supposedly uncomplicated areas. One such nagging problem that arose in
1965 was how to keep the command module windows clean. A fiber glass cap
with a cork ablator, called a boost protective cover, was attached to
the escape tower and fitted atop the spacecraft to protect the windows
during tower jettisoning. When tests showed that the cover would crack
and the plumes from the escape tower would deposit soot on the windows
and possibly cause other damage, North American bonded Nomex (a nylon
material strengthened with Teflon) between the fiber  glass and cork
layers of the cover to reinforce it.<a href = "#source9"><b>9</a></b><p>

And in areas where problems were expected to arise, they did. Two of the
tanks - one holding oxidizer and propellant for the command and service
module's reaction control thrusters (with which the spacecraft was
steered) and the other housing reactants for the fuel cells that
provided electrical power - were in trouble. The Bell Aerospace Systems
Company furnished North American with &quot;positive expulsion RCS
tanks,&quot; a system that forced propellant and oxidizer into the
firing chambers where the fluids would ignite on contact. The oxidizer
tanks kept failing, and Bell kept trying to fix them in an apparently
disorganized manner. Eventually, the trouble was traced to the oxidizer,
which had too little nitrous oxide in the nitrogen tetroxide, causing
stress corrosion (or cracking) in the tanks. When the nitrous oxide was
more carefully specified and controlled, the tanks stopped failing. The
hydrogen and oxygen fuel-cell-reactant storage tanks, tucked in a
service module bay, were also developing cracks. By August, Shea was
worrying whether Beech Aircraft, who supplied them, would be able to
diagnose and solve the problem in time for the early flights. With the
aid of Langley Research Center, the trouble was traced to a reaction of
the nitrogen tetroxide to the titanium used for the oxidizer tanks and
tubing. Beech simply installed stainless steel components, and the
problem ended.<a href = "#source10"><b>10</a></b><p>

Shea found that the penchant for unnecessary changes in Block II was
shared by some of the guidance and navigation system developers. On a
visit to Honeywell in May 1965, he learned that 50 percent of the
stabilization and control circuitry was new, 30 percent was slightly
modified, and only 20 percent was identical with Block I wiring.
Although he conceded that many of the changes were warranted, Block II
had been used to justify nonessential circuits, as well. Shea believed
that the Apollo office was inviting trouble; the changes had reached a
point where more time would be lost in trying to eliminate them.
Pressure was applied to make sure that North American kept its associate
contractors on both the spacecraft and guidance and navigation systems
up to date on changes; interface control documents would be used to
prevent this kind of problem in the future.<a href =
