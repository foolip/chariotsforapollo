<h2>The Astronauts and the Gemini Experience</h2>

<p>

Because of the heavy workload in Gemini and the upcoming missions in
Apollo, Robert Gilruth had convinced George Mueller the previous year
that he needed more astronauts. On 4 April 1966, NASA announced that 19
new flight candidates had been selected, bringing the roster up to 50.<a
href = "#explanation1"><b>*</b></a> Donald Slayton presided over the
corps, selecting and training the crews that were flying Gemini missions
almost bimonthly.<p>

Preparations for Gemini IX, the second mission scheduled for 1966, began
the year in tragedy when its prime crew, Elliot See and Charles Bassett,
crashed their aircraft into the building at McDonnell Aircraft
Corporation that housed the mission spacecraft. Both were killed. Thomas
Stafford and Eugene Cernan took over their duties. On 17 May, an Atlas
booster attempted to put an Agena target vehicle into orbit for Gemini
and failed. NASA launched a substitute vehicle, called the augmented
target docking adapter, on 1 June. Stafford and Cernan were ready to
follow, but problems with their guidance system and computer forced them
to wait two days before <cite>Gemini IX-A</cite> was launched to start
the chase. Once they caught up, they found that the launch shroud had
stuck to the substitute target, making it look, as Stafford said,
&quot;like an angry alligator.&quot; Although hopes for a second docking
in space were dashed, Stafford and Cernan carried out rendezvous
maneuvers in a variety of ways and Cernan spent two strenuous hours
outside of the spacecraft, trying in vain to ride an astronaut
maneuvering unit. Apollo mission planners examined these flight results
closely, looking for better operations and training procedures,
especially for extravehicular activity.<a href =

Six weeks after the Stafford-Cernan flight, on 18 July, John Young and
Michael Collins pushed off aboard <cite>Gemini X</cite> to rendezvous
with a pair of Agenas, one launched for their own mission and the other
left in orbit by <cite>Gemini VIII.</cite> They had trouble making the
initial rendezvous and used too much fuel; but, once hooked up to their
Agena, they found both high-altitude flight, to 763 kilometers, and a
meeting with the second Agena fairly simple. Using a hand gun, Collins
had such a successful period outside the spacecraft that some NASA
officials believed most of the extravehicular problems had been
overcome.<a href = "#source46"><b>46</b></a><p>

But on 12 September, with Charles Conrad at the helm of <cite>Gemini
XI,</cite> Richard Gordon found that moving about in space was as
difficult as Cernan had said. Gordon became totally exhausted trying to
hook a line between the spacecraft and target vehicle so the two craft
could separate, spin, and produce a small amount of artificial gravity.
He managed to finish the job, but at great physical cost. Nevertheless,
<cite>Gemini XI</cite> expanded manned space exploration to a distance
of nearly 1,400 kilometers above the earth to demonstrate that Apollo
spacecraft could travel safely through the trapped radiation zones on
their way to the moon. More importantly, perhaps, the crew carried out a
first-orbit rendezvous, to simulate the lunar module lifting off the
moon to meet the command module in lunar orbit, and made the first
computer-controlled reentry. Conrad checked his onboard data with
mission control, cut in his computer, and flew in on what amounted to an
automatic pilot - much as Apollo crews would have to do to hit the
narrow reentry corridor on their return to earth.<a href =

In the Gemini finale, NASA was intent on eliminating some of the mystery
of why man's work outside his spacecraft was so difficult. In
preparation for this, the astronauts began underwater training, which
simulated extravehicular activity more closely than the few seconds of
weightlessness that could be obtained during Keplerian trajectories in
aircraft. The pilot-controlled maneuvering unit was canceled after
Gordon's difficulties, so the <cite>Gemini XII</cite> crew could
concentrate on the &quot;fundamentals&quot; of extravehicular movements.
When James Lovell and Edwin Aldrin left the ground on 11 November, this
was really the chief objective of their mission. By this time, crew
systems personnel had attached enough rails and handholds here and there
about the spacecraft to give Aldrin a relatively easy five hours of work
outside the spacecraft.<a href = "#source48"><b>48</b></a><p>

Gemini made major contributions to Apollo and to the astronauts. Flight
control and tracking network personnel learned to conduct complex
missions with a variety of problems, and mission planners understood
more about what it would take to land men on the moon. Rendezvous was
demonstrated in so many ways that few engineers remembered they had ever
thought it might be difficult. Perhaps the biggest gain for the
astronauts was that 16 of the 50 had flown, operated controls, and
performed experiments in the weightlessness of space.<p>

Apollo astronauts, however, would rely more on simulators than on Gemini
experience. There were, or soon would be, three sets of these trainers -
two at Cape Kennedy and one in Houston - modeled after the command
module and the lunar module. The simulators, constantly being changed to
match the cabin of each individual spacecraft, were engineered to
provide their riders with all the sights, sounds, and movements they
would encounter in actual flight. Slayton had told George Mueller that
the crews would need 180 training hours in the command module simulator
and the flight commander and lunar module pilot an additional 140 hours
in the lunar module trainer - about 80 percent more training time than
the pilots of the early Gemini flights had required.<a href =

<a name = "explanation1"><b>*</b></a> The 19 candidates were Vance D.
Brand, John S. Bull, Gerald P. Carr, Charles M. Duke, Jr., Joe H. Engle,
Ronald E. Evans, Edward G. Givens, Jr., Fred W. Haise, Jr., James B.
Irwin, Don L. Lind, John R. Lousma, Thomas K. Mattingly II, Bruce
McCandless II, Edgar D. Mitchell, William R. Pogue, Stuart A. Roosa,
John L. Swigert, Jr., Paul J. Weitz, and Alfred M. Worden. Actually this
fifth set brought the total selected to 55, but the number on active
status had been reduced for a variety of reasons: John Glenn had
resigned to pursue a political and business career; Scott Carpenter had
returned to duty in the Navy; and Charles Bassett, Theodore Freeman, and
Elliot See had been killed in aircraft accidents.
