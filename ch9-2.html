<h1>Stalked by the Spectre</h1>

For almost a year, the Grissom crew had watched its craft go through the
production line, test program, and launch pad preparations. After
participating in a multitude of critiques, reading numerous discrepancy
reports, and going through several suited trials in the spacecraft in
altitude chambers at Downey and the Cape, Grissom's group had learned
almost all the idiosyncrasies of spacecraft 012. The astronauts knew, if
not every nut and bolt, at least the functions of its 88 subsystems and
the proper positions for hundreds of switches and controls inside the
cockpit. They also knew that the environmental unit had been causing
trouble. Indeed, Grissom's first reports on entering the cabin were of a
peculiar odor - like sour milk.<a href = "#explanation1"><b>*</b></a> <a
href = "#source3"><b>3</b></a><p>

As all traces of sea-level atmosphere were removed from the suit circuit
and spacecraft cabin, pure oxygen at a pressure of 11.5 newtons per
square centimeter (16.7 pounds per square inch) was substituted. The
crew checked lists, listened to the countdown, and complained about
communications problems<a href = "#explanation2"><b>**</b></a> that
caused intermittent delays. The men could speak over four channels,
either by radio or telephone line, but the tie - in with the test
conductors and the monitors was complicated and troublesome. Somewhere
there was an unattended live microphone that could not be tracked down
and turned off. Other systems, Grissom's crew noted, seemed to be
operating normally. At four in the afternoon, one shift of technicians
departed and another came on duty.<p>

Near sunset, early on this winter evening, communications problems again
caused a delay, this time for ten minutes, before the plugs could be
pulled. Thus, the test that should have been finished had not really
started, and an emergency egress practice was still to come. The crew
was accustomed to waiting, however, having spent similar long hours in
trouble-plagued training simulators. About 6:30, Grissom may have been
thinking about the jest he had played on Riley McCafferty by hanging a
lemon on the trainer.<a href = "#source4"><b>4</b></a><p>

Donald Slayton sat half a kilometer away at a console in the blockhouse
next to Stuart Roosa, the capsule communicator.<a href =
"#explanation3"><b>***</b></a> On the first floor of the launch complex,
Gary W. Propst, an RCA employee, watched a television monitor that had
its transmitting camera trained on the window of the command module.
Clarence A. Chauvin, the Kennedy Space Center test conductor, waited in
the automated checkout equipment room of the operations building, and
Darrell O. Gain, the North American test conductor, sat next door. NASA
quality control inspector Henry H. Rogers boarded the Pad 34 elevator to
ride up to the clean room. There, at the moment, were three North
American employees: Donald O. Babbitt, pad leader; James D. Gleaves,
mechanical technician; and L. D. Reece, systems technician. Reece was
waiting to pull the plugs on signal. Just outside on the swing arm,
Steven B. Clemmons and Jerry W. Hawkins were listening for Reece to call
them to come and help. All of these men and several others in the
vicinity at 6:31 heard a cry over the radio circuit from inside the
capsule: &quot;There is a fire in here.&quot;<a href =
"#source5"><b>5</b></a><p>

Stunned, pad leader Babbitt looked up from his desk and shouted to
Gleaves: &quot;Get them out of there!&quot; As Babbitt spun to reach a
squawk box to notify the blockhouse, a sheet of flame flashed from the
spacecraft. Then he was hurled toward the door by a concussion. In an
instant of terror, Babbitt, Gleaves, Reece, and Clemmons fled. In
seconds they rushed back, and Reece and Clemmons searched the area for
gas masks and for fire extinguishers to fight little patches of flame.
All four men, choking and gasping in dense smoke, ran in and out of the
enclosure, attempting to remove the spacecraft's hatches.<p>

Meanwhile, Propst's television picture showed a bright glow inside the
spacecraft, followed by flames flaring around the window. For about
three minutes, he recalled, the flames increased steadily. Before the
room housing the spacecraft filled with smoke, Propst watched with
horror as silver-clad arms behind the window fumbled for the hatch.
&quot;Blow the hatch, why don't they blow the hatch?&quot; he cried. He
did not know until later that the hatch could not be opened
explosively.<a href = "#explanation4"><b>****</b></a> Elsewhere, Slayton
and Roosa watched a television monitor, aghast, as smoke and fire
billowed up. Roosa tried and tried to break the communications barrier
with the spacecraft, and Slayton shouted furiously for the two
physicians in the blockhouse to hurry to the pad.<a href =
"#source6"><b>6</b></a><p>

In the clean room, despite the intense heat, Babbitt, Gleaves, Reese,
Hawkins, and Clemmons, now joined by Rogers, continued to fight the
flames. From time to time, one or another would have to leave to gasp
for air. One by one, they removed the booster cover cap and the outer
and inner hatches - prying out the last one five and a half minutes
after the alarm sounded. By now, several more workers had joined the
rescue attempt. At first no one could see the astronauts through the
smoke, only feel them. There were no signs of life. By the time firemen
arrived five minutes later, the air had cleared enough to disclose the
bodies. Chaffee was still strapped in his couch, but Grissom and White
were so intertwined below the hatch sill that it was hard to tell which
was which. Fourteen minutes after the first outcry of fire, physicians
G. Fred Kelly and Alan C. Harter reached the smoldering clean room. The
doctors had difficulty removing the bodies because the spacesuits had
fused with molten nylon inside the spacecraft.

As anguished officials gathered, the pad was cleared of unnecessary
personnel, guards were posted, and official photographers were summoned.
All through the night, physicians labored to complete their grim task.
After the autopsies were finished, the coroner reported that the deaths
were accidental, resulting from asphyxiation caused by inhalation of
toxic gases. The crew did have second and third degree burns, but these
were not severe enough to have caused the deaths.<a href =
"#source7"><b>7</b></a><p>

Most persons who had been connected with the space program in any way
remember that the tragedy caught them by surprise. In six years of
operation, 19 Americans had flown in space (7 of them, including
Grissom, twice) without serious injury. Procedures and precautions had
been designed to foresee and prevent hazards; now it was demoralizing to
realize the limits of human foresight. Several other astronauts had
died, but none in duties directly associated with space flight. Airplane
crashes had claimed the lives of Elliot See, Charles Bassett, and
Theodore Freeman. These were traumatic experiences, but the loss of
three men during a ground test for the first manned Apollo flight was a
more grievous blow.<p>

Memorial services for the AS-204 crewmen were held in Houston on 30
January, although their bodies had been flown north from Kennedy for
burial. Grissom and Chaffee were buried in Arlington National Cemetery
and White at the Military Academy at West Point. Amid these last rites,
a similar tragedy took the lives of two men in an oxygen-filled chamber
at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio. Airman 2/c William F. Bartley
and Airman 3/c Richard G. Harmon were drawing blood samples from rabbits
when a fire suddenly swept through the enclosure. The spacecraft and
chamber tragedies pinpointed the dangers inherent in advanced
space-simulation work.<a href = "#source8"><b>8</b></a><p>

The accident that took the lives of Grissom, White, and Chaffee was
heartrending, and some still insist totally unnecessary; but NASA had
always feared that, in manned space flight, danger to pilots could
increase with each succeeding program. Space flight officials had warned
against undue optimism for years, pointing out that any program that
large inevitably took its toll of lives - from accident, overwork, or
illness brought on by the pressures of such an undertaking. Man was
fallible; and a host of editorial cartoons reiterated this axiom for
several months after the fire. One, by Paul Conrad in the Los Angeles
Times, showed the spectre of death clothed in a spacesuit holding a
Mercury spacecraft in one hand, a Gemini in the other, and with the
smoldering Apollo in the background. It was captioned, &quot;I thought
you knew, I've been aboard on every flight.&quot;<a href =
"#source9"><b>9</b></a><p>

While preaching the need to promote quality workmanship, NASA managers
had relied on their contractors to invoke effective measures. NASA
executives knew they had tried to inspire the whole Apollo team to
strive for perfection, but the haunting question now was: Had they tried
hard enough? Every company and organization had a management scheme to
increase personal motivation by giving recognition to faultless
performance. North American had its &quot;PRIDE&quot; program, standing
for &quot;Personal Responsibility in Daily Effort,&quot; and NASA had
&quot;MFA&quot; for &quot;Manned Flight Awareness.&quot; The NASA
program also featured what was called the &quot;Lunar Roll of
Honor&quot;; the first lunar landing party would carry a microfilm
listing 300,000 names, honoring the exceptional service of those who had
aided significantly in the achievement. After the fire, the idea was
dropped. Just as it became obvious how difficult it was to fix the blame
for failure, it would later be come apparent that it would be equally
hard to pinpoint responsibility for success.<a href =
"#source10"><b>10</b></a><p>

In Washington on the day of the accident, an Apollo Executives'
Conference was in session, attended by NASA leaders James Webb, Robert
Seamans, and George Mueller and by top Gemini and Apollo corporate
officials, to mark the transition from two- to three-man space flight
operations. That morning the conferees had been invited to the White
House to witness the signing of a space treaty. President Johnson
described this event as the &quot;first firm step toward keeping outer
space free forever from the implements of war.&quot; Later, as the
tragic news from Pad 34 spread, the executives considered disbanding.
Administrator Webb, however, decided to carry on; Mueller would stay in
Washington and Seamans and Samuel Phillips would go to the Cape. The
next day, Mueller reported the first few meager facts to the meeting and
then gave a paper that Phillips had intended to present. Ironically,
Phillips had listed troubles with quality assurance among the top ten
problems faced in Apollo.<a href = "#source11"><b>11</b></a>

<hr>
<p>
<a name = "explanation1"><b>*</b></a> More than a week earlier, in an
altitude chamber test at the Cape, the crewmen had complained that their
eyes had smarted when they plugged the suit circuit into the
environmental control unit.<p>

<a name = "explanation2"><b>**</b></a> Earlier in January, Douglas
Broome of the Apollo office in Houston had recommended using heavier
wire in the communications systems. The size North American had
installed in spacecraft 012, he said, was too flimsy and too subject to
damage.<p>

<a name = "explanation3"><b>***</b></a> Both Slayton and Joseph Shea had
thought of joining the crew in the spacecraft to participate in the test
so they could get more feel for actual operations. This was not an
unusual procedure, but the time for the scheduled launch was too near.
Instead, Shea had flown back to Houston, and Slayton had elected to sit
with the CapCom and watch.

<p>
<a name = "explanation4"><b>****</b></a> After the loss of Grissom's
spacecraft in Mercury, when a faulty mechanism blew the hatch
prematurely, Space Task Group designers had gone from an explosive to a
mechanically operated hatch. This practice continued in Gemini and
Apollo.
