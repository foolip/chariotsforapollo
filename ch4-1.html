<h2>1962</h2>

<p>

During 1962, NASA faced three major tasks: keeping North American moving
on the command and service modules, defending its decision to fly the
lunar-orbit rendezvous mode, and finding a contractor to develop the
separate landing vehicle required by that approach.<p>

North American engineers spent the opening months of the year at desks,
at drawing boards, and in conference rooms. Although not all the pieces
of the Apollo stack had been defined, the first job was obviously to
build a three-man earth-orbital spacecraft. This Phase A or Block I
version, already worked out by NASA in considerable depth, still
required detailed analyses, precise engineering specifications, and
special manufacturing tools. The contractor also had to make scale-model
spacecraft for wind-tunnel tests and full-size mockups of wood and metal
for study and demonstration uses.<a href = "#source1"><b>1</b></a>
