<h1>Committees at Work</h1>

To begin upgrading NASA's tentative planning from circumlunar flights to
lunar landing missions, Seamans on 2 May set up an ad hoc group led by
William A. Fleming of Headquarters.<a href = "#explanation 1">*</a> The
task was reminiscent of that given to George Low's committee earlier in
the year, but the Fleming team was to place more emphasis on the landing
stage than Low's group had. Since Seamans had given him little time to
complete the study, Fleming settled on direct flight as the way to reach
the moon. For the final approach to landing, his group concluded, a
stage weighing 43,000 kilograms would be needed, with 85 percent of that
being the fuel load.<a href = "#source1">1</a><p>

Once Fleming had selected the direct route, Seamans realized that he
needed more options, so he formed a second committee, headed by Bruce
Lundin from the Lewis Research Center, to study the choices. The
eight-man committee<a href = "#explanation2">**</a> looked at
rendezvous, mostly earth-orbit rendezvous, in which two or more vehicles
would link up near the home planet and journey to the moon as a unit,
and lunar-orbit rendezvous, which required a single vehicle to fly to
the moon, orbit that body while one of its sections landed on the
surface and returned, and then travel back to earth.<p>

Lundin's group believed that rendezvous offered two attractions:
deciding on launch vehicle size - Nova or several proposed versions of
an advanced Saturn - would not restrict future growth; and rendezvous
would permit lunar landings to be made with smaller boosters, using
rocket engines already under development. The Lundin team favored
earth-orbit rendezvous, with two or three of the advanced Saturns. They
considered it safer, although they conceded that lunar-orbit rendezvous
would require less propellant and, in theory, could be done with a
single Saturn C-3, one of the versions under consideration.<a href =

NASA officials gathered on 10 June 1961 to hear what both Fleming and
Lundin had to report. Although the audience asked a few questions after
each presentation, it was obvious that neither committee had made real
progress. They did root out some difficulties that lay ahead and present
some suggestions on how a lunar landing might be made. But, actually,
little could be done at the time, and they knew it, since NASA did not
know how much money Congress intended to appropriate.<a href =

<a name = "explanation1">*</a> The Fleming Committee, composed of about
20 members from both Headquarters and the field centers, concluded that
&quot;it is not unreasonable to achieve the first attempt of a manned
lunar landing in 1967 provided there is a truly determined National
effort.&quot; Reaching this goal would depend on the development of an
adequate launch vehicle.<p>

<a name = "explanation2">**</a> Lundin's team consisted of Alfred Eggers
(Ames), Walter J. Downhower (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) , Lieutenant
Colonel George W. S. Johnson (Air Force) , Laurence Loftin (Langley) ,
Harry O. Ruppe (Marshall), and William J. D. Escher and Ralph May,
secretaries (NASA Headquarters).
