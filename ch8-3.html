<h1>Troubles and Troubleshooters</h1>

<p>

Saturn IB flights, for the most part, ran smoothly in 1966.
Unfortunately, this was not true for all of Apollo. Early in the year,
NASA Apollo Program Director Samuel Phillips and a cadre of analysts
completed a survey of vehicles and management at North American, after
several months of probing into activities at Downey, Seal Beach, and El
Segundo. Phillips' group noted that organizational and personnel
weaknesses were hampering the contractor's attempts to meet command and
service module schedules, but the biggest problem was the S-II second
stage of the launch vehicle, which threatened to block the chances of
flying an all-up vehicle on the first Saturn V launch.<p>

Despite two successful ground tests, on 29 December 1965 and 12 January
1966, the S-II was behind schedule and in trouble. North American
realized this and hired a new manager, Robert E. Greer, a retired Air
Force general, to get S-II development back on the track. By spring,
Greer and his troops had gone to the Mississippi Test Facility, near the
Pearl River north of New Orleans, to begin an intensive ground test
program. For 15 seconds on 23 April, the five J-2 liquid-oxygen and
liquid-hydrogen engines roared into action, producing the designed
thrust of 4.5 million newtons (one million pounds).<a href =

<cite>J-2 engines at the Rocketdyne plant in California. Five of these
engines propelled by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, were used in the
Saturn V's S-II second stage, and one was used in its S-IVB third stage
(the S-IVB was also the second stage of the Saturn IB).</cite>

Three more firings were attempted - on 10, 11, and 16 May - but the
engines were cut off too soon by faulty instrumentation. In two more
tests, on the 17th and 20th, the engines fired for 150 and 350 seconds.
The next scheduled 350-second test, on 25 May, met problems when fire
broke out in two places on the S-II. Three days later, while the stage
was being removed from the stand, a liquid-hydrogen tank exploded,
injuring five persons and damaging the test stand.<a href =

Although it was a gloomy day in Mississippi, 25 May 1966 was still a
milestone for Saturn V. Two states away, in Florida, NASA ceremoniously
rolled out its 2,700-metric-ton, diesel-powered, steel-link-tread
crawler-transporter loaded with the 111-meter-tall, 196,000-kilogram<a
href = "#explanation1"><b>*</b></a> Apollo-Saturn vehicle. Just before
this impressive mass began moving at a snail's pace away from the
Vehicle Assembly Building, NASA Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans
said: &quot;I for one questioned whether a vehicle the size of Apollo
Saturn could get out to the pad . . . or not.&quot; It could.<a href =
"#source14"><b>14</b></a><p>

However well the rollout augured for Apollo's eventual success, right
then the S-II stage was in trouble. NASA Manned Space Flight Director
George Mueller began sending weekly assessments of S-II progress to J.
Leland Atwood, warning the president of North American that the S-II
stood a good chance of replacing the lunar module as the pacing item in
Apollo. But Atwood already knew it. That was why he had hired Greer - to
bring the S-II more attention at a higher level of management.<a href =
"#source15"><b>15</b></a><p>

Mueller also told Atwood that Phillips, on his return from the West
Coast, had pointed out problems with the spacecraft. Both earth-orbital
(Block I) and lunar-orbital (Block II) versions of the command module
were being plagued during manufacturing by late hardware deliveries from
subcontractors and vendors. The most troublesome had been the
environmental control unit being developed by AiResearch. Phillips had
chided the subcontractor by letter for its poor performance. In October
Atwood admitted to Mueller that this system was the most serious threat
to meeting spacecraft schedules for the first manned Apollo flight.<a
href = "#source16"><b>16</b></a><p>

Phillips' troubleshooting set a pattern for Apollo in 1966; many
managers and subsystem managers found themselves dealing, often
full-time, with the difficulties in getting qualified vehicles to the
launch pad. One of the Houston managers who spent a lot of time trying
to straighten out some subsystem that was in trouble was Rolf W,
Lanzkron. Phillips had asked Shea to send Lanzkron to General Electric
in late 1965 to help get the manufacturer of the ground checkout
equipment onto the right path. While Lanzkron was there, GE's general
manager for the program, Roy H. Beaton, commented in a letter to
Phillips:

<blockquote><p>As you might well guess he beat the living h--- out of us, .
. . spurring us on to more effective utilization of our previously
mammoth efforts. Despite the bruises, we feel that we are a far more
effective organization now as a result of his leadership.<a href =
"#source17"><b>17</b></a></blockquote><p>

And Lanzkron traveled elsewhere. On one occasion he went to Phoenix,
where the Sperry Company was having a hard time with the guidance and
navigation gyroscopes. For several years, Sperry had been using a
commercial detergent, one that many housewives use for washing dishes,
to remove grease from the gyro's bearings. Suddenly something went wrong
- the grease was not coming off. Baffled at first, Lanzkron and Sperry's
own troubleshooters finally discovered that Procter and Gamble had
changed its product to include an additive that was supposed to make it
better for dishwashing.<p>

It may have helped the housewife, but the &quot;improved&quot; product
certainly hindered the cleaning of the bearings.<a href =
"#source18"><b>18</b></a> Solving the gyro problem was a minor
achievement in getting systems ready for flight. Over in the state of
New York, however, more complex technical, financial, and managerial
problems would demand the attention of many, many troubleshooters.
