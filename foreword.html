<p>
The story of Apollo is a remarkable chapter in the history of mankind.
How remarkable will be determined by future generations as they attempt
to assess and understand the relationship and significance of the Apollo
achievements to the development of mankind. We hope that this book will
contribute to their assessments and assist in their judgments.

<p>
Writing the history of Apollo has been a tremendous undertaking. There
is so much to tell; there are so many facets. The story of Apollo is
filled with facts and figures about complex machines, computers, and
facilities, and intricate maneuvers - these are the things with which
the Apollo objectives were achieved. But a great effort has also been
made to tell the real story of Apollo, to identify and describe the
decisions and actions of men and women that led to the creation and
operation of those complex machines.

<p>
The flights of Apollo were the focus of worldwide reporting and
attention. The success of these flights is directly attributable to the
less well reported and less visible work of nearly 400,000 people in
hundreds of different organizations. That the efforts of so many could
be organized and coordinated so effectively is a tribute to American
ingenuity and management abilities. Moreover, only those who were
directly involved can fully appreciate the dedication, competence,
courage, teamwork, and hard work of those people.

<p>
It is not possible to single out any one or even a few of the many
people and the countless decisions, actions, and key events in the
program as being more critical or important than the others in
determining its ultimate success. Nor is it appropriate to do so since
that success could not have been achieved without having first succeeded
in building effective teamwork in an environment where every task, no
matter how seemingly insignificant at the time, in some way affected the
ultimate outcome of the program.

<p>
It was a rare personal privilege for me to serve on the Apollo program.
The greatest reward was the opportunity to work with the many people in
government, industry, and other organizations in this country and around
the world who played a part in this tremendous undertaking. Words cannot
adequately describe the extraordinary ingenuity and selfless devotion
that were so often displayed by so many in surmounting the multitude of
problems and obstacles that developed along the way. This program surely
demonstrated what our great country can accomplish when the national
will and leadership steadfastly support a competent and dedicated group
of people who are unwaveringly committed to attaining a seemingly
unattainable objective.

<p>
I hope that this book will not only serve future generations as they
view the Apollo story in a historical perspective, but will also bring
the satisfaction of a job well done to all those who served in the
Apollo program.
