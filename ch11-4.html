<h1><i>Apollo 7:</i> The Magnificent Flying Machine</h1>

<p>

CSM-101 started through the manufacturing cycle early in 1966. By July,
it had been formed, wired, fitted with subsystems, and made ready for
testing. After the fire in January 1967, redefinition forced changes,
mainly in the wiring, hatch areas, and forward egress tunnel. It was
December before the spacecraft came back into testing. CSM-101 passed
through a three-phase customer acceptance review; during the third
session, held in Downey on 7 May 1968, no items showed up that might be
a &quot;constraint to launch.&quot; North American cleared up what few
deficiencies there were (13) and shipped the craft to Kennedy on 30
May.<a href = "#source23"><b>23</a></b><p>

Low had spent a lot of time thinking about a flight to the moon before
1968 ended, but Apollo 7 still was given his close attention. He
probably worried about that flight more than those that followed because
the earlier attempt to get a crew skyborne had ended in disaster. After
rereading the evaluations of the fourth, fifth, and sixth missions, Low
asked Simpkinson, one of his chief troubleshooters, to make up a
&quot;worry list&quot; of things that might have been overlooked. He
also asked John Hodge's Crew Safety Review Board to question all the
&quot;judgment decisions&quot; that separately had made good sense,
making sure that the sum of them still did. Aaron Cohen, who reviewed
them for Low, concluded that, individually and collectively, these
decisions had been sound. Out at North American, Dale Myers was doing
the same soul-searching, looking specifically at the 137 changes that
had resulted from the spacecraft 012 fire.<a href =
"#source24"><b>24</a></b><p>

All this care paid off. At the Flight Readiness Review on 20 September,
Myers reported that CSM-101 was &quot;a very good spacecraft.&quot;
Walter J. Kapryan of Kennedy said the launch preparations people
agreed.<a href = "#source25"><b>25</b></a> Now it was up to the flight
crew to prove them right.<p>

In October 1968, Schirra, a veteran of both Mercury and Gemini, found
himself facing a situation similar to some he had encountered in
previous Octobers. In 1962, his Mercury-Atlas 8 mission had been a
six-orbit engineering test to see if Mercury's legs might be stretched
to a full day's flight; three years later his Gemini VI had been an
engineering test to attempt the first rendezvous with a second vehicle
in space.<p>

The primary objectives for Apollo 7, also an engineering test flight,
were simple: &quot;Demonstrate CSM/crew performance; demonstrate
crew/space vehicle mission support facilities performance during a
manned CSM mission; demonstrate CSM rendezvous capability.&quot;<p>

Phillips wrote Webb that these objectives could be met within 3 days but
that the mission would be open-ended up to 11 days &quot;to acquire
additional data and evaluate the aspects of long duration manned space
flight.&quot; This did leave some time for taking pictures of weather
and terrain that might be of interest to the scientific community.<a
href = "#source26"><b>26</a></b><p>

One piece of equipment got aboard Apollo 7 and all subsequent manned
flights in spite of the insistence of most engineers that it was not
needed and the ambivalence of the test-pilot-oriented crews. This was
the television camera. Ever since September 1963, when NASA had first
directed North American to install a portable camera in the spacecraft,
that device had been going in and out of the craft as though it were
caught in a revolving door. Wrestling with the constant problem of
overweight, many engineers viewed television cameras only as nice things
to have. On occasions when kilograms, and even grams, were being shaved
from the command module, the camera was among the first items to go.
There were those, however, who persistently argued for the inclusion of
television.<p>

NASA personnel in charge of public information activities - Julian
Scheer in Washington and Paul P. Haney in Houston - naturally favored
the use of television, but there was one management-level engineer in
the Houston Apollo office who agreed with them. In the spring of 1964,
William A. Lee wrote:<p>

<blockquote>I take typewriter in hand to plead once more for including
in-flight TV. . . . Since [it] has little or no engineering value, the
weight penalty must be assessed against a different set of standards. .
. . One [objective] of the Apollo Program is to impress the world with
our space supremacy. It may be assumed that the first attempt to land on
the moon will have generated a high degree of interest around the world.
. . . A large portion of the civilized world will be at their TV sets
wondering whether the attempt will succeed or fail. The question before
the house is whether the public will receive their report of this
climactic moment visually or by voice alone.<a href =
"#source27"><b>27</b></a> </blockquote><p>

Four springs later, following more trips through the revolving door,
television became part of Apollo when Phillips told Low to install a
camera on CSM-101.<a href = "#source28"><b>28</a></b>

<cite>Apollo 7, first manned Apollo flight, 11-22 October 1968. The
Saturn IB, like earlier launch vehicles, was assembled at the launch
pad. Saturn 205's first stage rests on the pedestal at Launch Complex 34
before mating with other stages for launch.</cite>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

As the Apollo 7 crew and its guests ate the traditional launch-day
breakfast, a few nostalgic thoughts flitted through the minds of at
least some present. For at least two members of the morning
get-together, the thoughts had to be tinged with sadness. On 16
September, to the surprise of nearly everyone, Webb had announced that
he was retiring on 6 October, his 62nd birthday. After almost eight
years at the helm of NASA, Webb stepped down, apparently to smooth the
transition to a new administration in the White House. Paine, his
deputy, became acting administrator. Four days after the Webb
announcement, Schirra said this would be his last mission, as he, too,
planned to retire.<a href = "#source29"><b>29</a></b><p>

So feelings of regret mixed with anticipation as more than 600 news
media representatives watched the first manned Apollo flight -
<cite>Apollo 7</cite> - speed skyward from Launch Complex 34 a few
minutes after 11:00 on the morning of 11 October. Once Saturn IB 205 and
CSM-101 (the first Block II CSM) cleared the pad in Florida, a
three-shift mission control team - led by flight directors Glynn Lunney,
Eugene Kranz, and Gerald D. Griffin - in Houston took over. Schirra,
Eisele, and Cunningham inside the command module had listened to the
sound of propellants rushing into the firing chambers, had noticed the
vehicles swaying slightly, and had felt the vibrations at ignition. Ten
and a half minutes after launch, with little bumpiness and low g loads
during acceleration, <cite>Apollo 7</cite> reached the first stage of
its journey, an orbital path 227 by 285 kilometers above the earth.

<p align=center>
<img src = "images/c270b.jpg" width=417 height=409 ALT="Apollo 7 rendezvous with S-IVB"><p>

<cite>After launch and a rendezvous maneuver, the Apollo 7 crew examines
the Saturn's S-IVB stage (above) that had placed them in orbit. Meeting
no problems in the maneuver, the crew concluded that future pilots would
have no difficulty docking with the lunar module.</cite>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

A few hours later, as the spacecraft separated from the S-IVB stage and
then turned back in a simulated docking approach, Cunningham described
the S-IVB, which would be used for rendezvous target practice the next
day. The spacecraft-lunar module adapter panels, he said, had not fully
deployed - which naturally reminded Stafford, on the capsule
communicator (CapCom) console, of the &quot;angry alligator&quot; target
vehicle he had encountered on his <cite>Gemini IX</cite> mission. This
mishap would have been embarrassing on a mission that carried a lunar
module, but the panels would be jettisoned explosively on future
flights.<a href = "#source30"><b>30</a></b><p>

After this niggling problem, service module engine performance was a
joy. This was one area where the crew could not switch to a redundant or
backup system; at crucial times during a lunar voyage, the engine simply
had to work or they would not get back home. On <cite>Apollo 7,</cite>
there were eight nearly perfect firings out of eight attempts. On the
first, the crew had a real surprise. In contrast to the smooth liftoff
of the Saturn, the blast from the service module engine jolted the
astronauts, causing Schirra to yell &quot;Yabadabadoo&quot; like Fred
Flintstone in the contemporary video cartoon. Later, Eisele said,
&quot;We didn't quite know what to expect, but we got more than we
expected.&quot; He added more graphically that it was a real boot in the
rear that just plastered them into their seats. But the engine did what
it was supposed to do each time it fired.<a href =
"#source31"><b>31</a></b><p>

With few exceptions, the other systems in the spacecraft operated as
they should. Occasionally, one of the three fuel cells supplying
electricity to the craft developed some unwanted high temperatures, but
load-sharing hookups among the cells prevented any power shortage. The
crew complained about noisy fans in the environmental circuits and
turned one of them off. That did not help much, so the men switched off
the other. The cabin stayed comfortable, although the coolant lines
sweated and water collected in little puddles on the deck, which the
crew expected after the Kerwin team's test in the altitude chamber.
Schirra's crew vacuumed the excess water out into space with the urine
dump hose.<a href = "#source32"><b>32</a></b><p>

Visibility from the spacecraft windows ranged from poor to good, during
the mission. Shortly after the launch escape tower jettisoned, two of
the windows had soot deposits and two others had water condensation. Two
days later, however, Cunningham reported that most of the windows were
in fairly good shape, although moisture was collecting between the inner
panes of one window. On the seventh day, Schirra described essentially
the same conditions.<p>

Even with these impediments, the windows were adequate. Those used for
observations during rendezvous and stationkeeping with the S-IVB
remained almost clear. Navigational sighting with a telescope and a
sextant on any of the 37 preselected &quot;Apollo&quot; stars was
difficult if done too soon after a waste-water dump. Sometimes they had
to wait several minutes for the frozen particles to disperse. Eisele
reported that unless he could see at least 40 or 50 stars at a time he
found it hard to decide what part of the sky he was looking toward. On
the whole, however, the windows were satisfactory for general and
landmark observations and for out-the-window photography.<a href =
"#source33"><b>33</a></b><p>

Most components supported the operations and well-being of the
spacecraft and crew as planned, in spite of minor irritations like
smudging windows and puddling water. For example, the waste management
system for collecting solid body wastes was adequate, though annoying.
The defecation bags, containing a germicide to prevent bacteria and gas
formation, were easily sealed and stored in empty food containers in the
equipment bay. But the bags were certainly not convenient and there were
usually unpleasant odors. Each time they were used, it took the crew
member from 45 to 60 minutes, causing him to postpone it as long as
possible, waiting for a time when there was no work to do. The crew had
a total of only 12 defecations over a period of nearly 11 days.
Urination was much easier, as the crew did not have to remove clothing.
There was a collection service for both the pressure suits and the
inflight coveralls. Both devices could be attached to the urine dump
hose and emptied into space. They had half expected the hose valve to
freeze up in vacuum, but it never did.<a href =
"#source34"><b>34</a></b><p>

The astronauts finally had a spacecraft large enough to move about in.
During Gemini, crewmen had gone outside the craft in an exercise called
extravehicular activity, or EVA. In Apollo, quite naturally, the
abbreviation became IVA, for intravehicular activity. The crew adapted
easily to this new free-floating realm. Schirra said, &quot;All the
problems we worried about the spacecraft picking up motions from the
crew, no such thing. . . . You get to be quite a gymnast.&quot; And
Cunningham later added, &quot;The work is almost zero, and you can move
any place you want to very freely, and you certainly don't need strong
handholds to take care of it.&quot; The crew found exercise was
important. At first, when the men slept in the couches their bodies
curled up into the fetal position, which gave them lower back and
abdominal pains. So they almost raced each other for a workout on a
stretching device called an Exer-Genie, which relaxed their cramped and
aching muscles.<a href = "#source35"><b>35</a></b><p>

The crew slept well enough, but Schirra complained about round-the-clock
operations that disrupted the normal, earth-bound routine. Sleep periods
might start as early as 4:00 in the afternoon or as late as 4:00 in the
morning. Slayton suggested that all three astronauts sleep at the same
time, but Schirra said the machine was flying well and he did not want
to make any changes. So Eisele kept watch while the others slept, and
then he went to bed. Two sleeping bags were underneath the outboard
couches (the center couch could be moved out of the way), and the
crewmen could zip themselves into them, wearing their flight coveralls.
The bags were not popular, because, they said, the restraints were in
the wrong places. Cunningham preferred sleeping in the couch, strapping
himself down with a shoulder harness and a lap belt. If two crewmen
slept in the couches at the same time, however, one of them was always
in the way of spacecraft operations. After the third day, the crew had
worked out a routine that allowed all of them to get enough sleep.<a
href = "#source36"><b>36</a></b><p>

Although the astronauts had more than 60 food items to choose from,
giving them about 2,500 calories a day, they were not happy with their
fare. The bite-size food crumbled and stray particles floated around the
cabin. They almost came to hate the high-energy sweets and tried to talk
each other out of the more satisfactory breakfast items. Following his
Gemini flight, Schirra had said that if he flew on Apollo he was going
to take some coffee with him. And he did. During flight and later, the
crew emphasized that space food was a long way from satisfying their
normal table habits.<a href = "#source37"><b>37</a></b>

<p align=center>
<img src = "images/c270c.jpg" width=538 height=399 ALT="Live TV from Apollo 7 in MOCR"><p>

<cite>Mission Control watches the first live television beamed by an
American spacecraft, as Eisele and Schirra signal, &quot;Keep Those
Cards and Letters Coming in, Folks.&quot;</cite>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

The astronauts did use the controversial television camera to show their
colleagues in mission control and the public everywhere how they got
along in their living quarters, operated the spacecraft, ate, and swam
about in the weightlessness of space. When flight plan changes crowded
their schedule, Schirra canceled the first of several planned television
demonstrations. Slayton tried to change his mind, but the spacecraft
commander told him sharply that there would be no show that day. The
programs finally began, however, and the crew appeared to enjoy them,
using cue cards - &quot;Keep Those Cards and Letters Coming In,
Folks&quot; and &quot;Hello from the Lovely Apollo Room High Atop
Everything&quot; - supplied by Michael Kapp,<a href =
"#explanation1"><b>*</b></a> who also provided cassettes for their
musical enjoyment.<a href = "#source38"><b>38</a></b><p>

Some of the crew's grumpiness during the mission could be attributed to
physical discomfort. About 15 hours into the flight, Schirra developed a
bad cold, and Cunningham and Eisele soon followed suit. A cold is
uncomfortable enough on the ground; in weightless space it presents a
different problem. Mucus accumulates, filling the nasal passages, and
does not drain from the head. The only relief is to blow hard, which is
painful to the ear drums. So the crewmen of <cite>Apollo 7</cite>
whirled through space suffering from stopped up ears and noses. They
took aspirin and decongestant tablets and discussed their symptoms with
the doctors.<p>

Several days before the mission ended, they began to worry about wearing
their suit helmets during reentry, which would prevent them from blowing
their noses. The buildup of pressure might burst their eardrums.
Slayton, in mission control, tried to persuade them to wear the helmets,
anyway, but Schirra was adamant. They each took a decongestant pill
about an hour before reentry and made it through the acceleration zone
without any problems with their ears.<a href = "#source39"><b>39</a></b>

That &quot;magnificent flying machine,&quot; as Cunningham called it,
circled the earth for more than 260 hours. On 22 October, the crew
brought the ship down in the Atlantic southeast of Bermuda, less than
two kilometers from the planned impact point. On landing, the craft
turned nose down, but the crew quickly inflated the air bags and the
ship righted itself. The tired, but happy, voyagers were picked up by
helicopter and deposited on the deck of the U.S.S. <cite>Essex</cite>.<a

<cite>Apollo 7</cite> accomplished what it set out to do - qualifying
the command and service module and clearing the way for the proposed
lunar-orbit mission to follow. And its activities were of national
interest. A special edition of NASA's news clipping collection called
&quot;Current News&quot; included front page stories from 32 major
newspapers scattered over the length and breadth of the nation. Although
the postmission celebrations<a href = "#source41"><b>41</b></a> may not
have rivaled those for the first orbital flight of an American, John
Glenn in 1962, enthusiasm was high - and this fervor would build to even
greater heights each time the lunar landing goal drew one step closer.
