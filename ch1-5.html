<h1>Focusing the Aim</h1><p>

The Goett Committee did only what it was set up to do - study possible
options and suggest objectives that NASA might pursue - but its findings
did focus attention on manned circumlunar flight. Well before the
committee discontinued its meetings, small groups at nearly all of the
field centers had taken the initiative and started research toward that
goal.<p>

For example, during the summer of 1959, Gilruth formed a New Projects
Panel within the Space Task Group under H. Kurt Strass.<a href =
"#explanation1">*</a> Meeting twice in August, the panel members
identified a number of areas for research and recommended that work
begin immediately on an advanced manned capsule, a second-generation
spacecraft crewed by three men and capable of reentering the atmosphere
at speeds nearly as great as those needed to escape the earth's
gravitational pull. The group was clearly planning a lunar spacecraft.
Convinced that this should be the Space Task Group's next major project,
the members further agreed that manned lunar landing should be the goal
to design toward, and they assumed 1970 as a suitable target date.<a

At the third meeting of the panel, on 28 September, Alan Kehlet
presented some ideas for a lenticular reentry vehicle. (Later, he and
William W. Petynia worked out enough details to apply for a patent on a
capsule that appeared to be formed by two convex lenses and looked like
a flying saucer.)<a href = "#source25">25</a><p>

The thinking of the New Projects Panel - and that was all Gilruth
intended it to do, think - may have been premature, but it pointed out
the need to raise the level and amount of manpower invested in planning
advanced spacecraft systems.<a href = "#explanation2">**</a> At a Space
Task Group management meeting on 2 November 1959, Gilruth assigned
Robert O. Piland, Strass, John D. Hodge, and Caldwell Johnson to delve
into &quot;preliminary design of a multiman (probably 3)&quot;
circumlunar spacecraft and into mission analyses of trajectories,
weights, and propulsion needs.<a href = "#source26">26</a><p>

Piland's group focused on circumlunar flight as NASA's immediate
objective. The team members dealt mostly with spacecraft design, but
they also dipped fairly deeply into mission analyses. They adopted the
idea of flying directly from the earth to the moon's surface. Again,
however, these studies by the Space Task Group at Langley were only part
of similar efforts going on concurrently at NASA Headquarters, at
Langley, at Ames, at Lewis, and at several industrial contractors'
plants. After the thinking, the task of picking and choosing what to do
would begin.<a href = "#source27">27</a><p>

At Headquarters, toward the end of 1959, the Office of Program Planning
and Evaluation, headed by Homer J. Stewart, drew up a &quot;Ten Year
Plan.&quot; Much of it, especially the part dealing with manned flight,
evolved from the Goett Committee's priority list. In addition to a
program of unmanned lunar and planetary exploration, it called for
manned circumlunar flights and a permanent space station in earth orbit
by the late 1960s. Lunar landings were projected for some time after
1970.<p>

The Headquarters plan recommended developing more powerful engines and
fitting them to huge Nova-class launch vehicles, as the most practical
means of getting to the moon. Studies of rendezvous in space were under
way as a part of the Saturn vehicle lunar mission analysis, but
Stewart's group anticipated that manned lunar exploration would depend
on Nova.<a href = "#source28">28</a><p>

To clarify some of the thinking about designing manned spacecraft and
missions for them, Administrator Glennan in December 1959 set up another
in the long string of committees (and there would be a plethora of these
before Apollo took on its final form), this time to try to define more
precisely just what would make up the Saturn rocket systems. With Abe
Silverstein as chairman, this group consisted of Colonel Norman C.
Appold of the Air Force, Abraham Hyatt and committee secretary Eldon W.
Hall of NASA, von Braun of the Army's ABMA, George P. Sutton of the
Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency, and Thomas C.
Muse of the Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering.
There had been a lot of talk about what kinds of propellants to use in
the vehicle's upper stages. The Lewis laboratory had researched the
potentials of liquid hydrogen in combination with liquid oxygen
throughout the mid-1950s. Department of Defense and NASA research was
aimed at prototypes of the Centaur rocket to prove the worth of these
high-energy, low-weight propellant systems. The most important result of
the committee was that Silverstein and his team hammered out a unanimous
recommendation that all upper stages should be fueled with
hydrogen-oxygen propellants. This determination, like many others, was a
significant piece of the launch vehicle puzzle.<a href =
"#source29">29</a><p>

Calendar year 1959 had been fruitful for those who saw the moon as
manned space flight's next goal. NASA's leaders were coming around to
that viewpoint and, on 7 January 1960 in a meeting with his staff,
Glennan concurred that the follow-on program to Project Mercury should
have an end objective of manned flight to the moon.<a href =
"#source30">30</a> NASA had its ten-year plan to present to Congress and
a reasonable assurance of getting President Eisenhower's approval to
speed up the development of a large launch vehicle.

C. Johnson, Jr., Harry H. Ricker, Jr., and Stanley C. White.<p>

<a name = "explanation2">**</a> By June of 1959 the original Space Task
Group complement of 45 had grown to 367. Gilruth anticipated that the
personnel requirements for fiscal year 1961 would be 909; most of the
new employees would be assigned to a maneuverable manned satellite, a
manned orbiting laboratory, and a manned lunar expedition.
