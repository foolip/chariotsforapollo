<h2>1965</h2>

For the most part, 1965 was a good year for manned space flight. Gemini
astronauts flew five missions, all successful, one lasting two weeks and
including the world's first rendezvous in space. A series of unmanned
flights banished many old specters of doom: three Pegasus satellites
proved micrometeoroids were not as hazardous in near-earth space as some
had prophesied, and two Ranger spacecraft, before crashing on the moon,
sent back pictures that gave some assurance that Surveyor and Apollo
could safely fly to and land on the lunar surface. Apollo's eventual
success seemed certain, but first all its far-flung pieces had to be
brought together in some semblance of order. For Apollo, therefore, 1965
was a trying, yet fruitful, year.
