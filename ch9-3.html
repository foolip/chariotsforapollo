<h1>The Investigation</h1>

<p>

After the fire, amid all the grief and the shock that it could have
happened, a thorough fact-finding investigation was conducted. Webb and
Seamans asked Floyd L. Thompson, Director of Langley Research Center, to
take charge of the inquiry. Thompson and Seamans met at Kennedy at noon
on 28 January for a brief session with other Headquarters, Houston, and
Cape officials and then adjourned to Complex 34 to see the scene of the
accident.<a href = "#source12"><b>12</a></b><p>

Seamans returned to Washington that evening, consulted with Webb, and
drafted a memorandum formalizing the AS-204 Review Board with Thompson
as chairman. Members were astronaut Frank Borman and Max Faget of the
Manned Spacecraft Center, E. Barton Geer of Langley Research Center,
George W. Jeffs of North American, Franklin A. Long of Cornell
University and the President's Science Advisory Committee, Colonel
Charles F. Strang of the Air Force Inspector General's office, George C.
White of NASA Headquarters, and John J. Williams of Kennedy Space
Center.<p>

The board quickly established tight security at Complex 34, impounded
documents pertaining to the accident, and collected eyewitness reports.
News media representatives swarmed in to cover the story, and their
unofficial investigations and semifactual innuendos filled newsprint and
airwaves throughout the following weeks. Many looked for quick answers
and simple explanations, but by 3 February it was obvious to NASA
officials, at least, that no single cause for the accident could be
isolated immediately. Seamans and Thompson set up 21 panels to assist
the review board. When he realized that full-time participation was
expected, Long asked to be excused. He was replaced by Robert W. Van
Dolah, an explosives expert from the Bureau of Mines. In other personnel
actions, Seamans asked Jeffs to serve as a consultant rather than as a
board member and George T. Malley, chief counsel at Langley, to act as
legal advisor.<a href = "#source13"><b>13</a></b><p>

Anticipating public clamor for answers and reforms, if not postponement
of Apollo, NASA officials asked leading members of Congress to hold off
on a full-scale investigation until the review board finished its
report. Senator Clinton P. Anderson, Chairman, agreed to call the Senate
Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences into executive session
only, for its early investigations. And Representative George P. Miller,
Chairman of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said Olin
Teague's Subcommittee on NASA Oversight would not begin hearings until
the Thompson Board had submitted its report. Many newsmen charged that
the full story would never be known, since most of the board members
were NASA employees; others conjectured that Apollo might be grounded
altogether. Meanwhile, the Apollo 204 Review Board went systematically
about its business.<a href = "#source14"><b>14</a></b><p>

Seamans returned to Florida on 2 February to prepare a preliminary
report for Webb. Although this was made public just a few days later,
accusations still swirled that the NASA investigation could not be
impartial since it was a probe of the agency by itself. There were also
sensationalistic charges such as those in Eric Bergaust's book,
<cite>Murder on Pad 34,</cite> a year and a half later. Bergaust said
that NASA, even while denying that it was in a space race, had
nevertheless placed speed above safety.<a href =
"#source15"><b>15</a></b><p>

But there was plenty of evidence that meeting schedules was not the
whole story. &quot;We're in a risky business,&quot; Grissom himself had
said in an interview several weeks before the fire, &quot;and we hope if
anything happens to us, it will not delay the program. The conquest of
space is worth the risk of life.&quot; He was later quoted as saying,
&quot;Our God-given curiosity will force us to go there ourselves
because in the final analysis only man can fully evaluate the moon in
terms understandable to other men.&quot;<a href =
"#source16"><b>16</a></b><p>

Congressional leaders did not entirely share the views and misgivings of
the press. In a bipartisan move, Senators Anderson and Margaret Chase
Smith arranged for publication of the executive hearings of 7 February
with Seamans, Mueller, Charles A. Berry (Houston's medical director of
manned space flight), and Richard Johnston (spacesuit and life support
systems expert). This openness of congressional deliberations helped to
defuse media criticism about the objectivity of the ongoing
investigation.<a href = "#source17"><b>17</a></b>

Spacecraft 014, nearly identical to 012, was shipped from California to
Florida. There the Thompson Board and its panels had the vehicle
dismantled for comparison with the remains of 012, which was being taken
apart and every piece studied and analyzed. Thompson took advantage of
the background and experience of his board members, assigning some to
monitor several of the panels. While technicians worked around the clock
for the first few weeks, the board held daily recorded and transcribed
sessions to consider the findings. Strang was an effective
vice-chairman, drawing on his background as an inspector to organize
proceedings and prepare comprehensive reports. Van Dolah, the mining
explosives expert, had only one panel - origin and propagation of the
fire - to monitor, emphasizing the importance of finding that answer.
Thompson reserved a single panel, medical analysis, for himself.<p>

Faget had the heaviest load of panels: sequence of events, materials
review, special tests, and integration analysis. Borman drew the teams
on disassembly, ground emergency provisions, and inflight fire emergency
provisions. Williams monitored the spacecraft and ground support
equipment configuration, test procedures review, and service module
disposition. George White, quality and reliability chief from
Headquarters, was responsible for investigations into test environments,
design reviews, and historical data. An associate of Thompson's from
Langley, Geer handled the groups on the analysis of spacecraft
fractures, the board's administrative procedures, and the safety of the
investigation operations themselves. Strang was left with the panels
taking statements from witnesses, handling the security operations of
the inquiry, and writing up the final report.<p>

When Seamans made a second preliminary report to Webb, on 14 February,
it was clear that the fire was indeed a fire, and not an explosion
leading to a fire. Physical evidence indicated that the conflagration
had passed through more than one stage of intensity before the oxygen
inside the cabin was used up. By mid-February, the work of tearing down
the command module had reached a point where a two-shift six-day week
could replace round-the-clock operations.<p>

On the day of the scheduled launch of AS-204, 21 February, the board
gave a preliminary briefing to George Mueller and a dozen other top NASA
officials in preparation for a major briefing of Seamans. Thompson told
Seamans the next day that 1,500 persons were directly supporting the
investigation - 600 from government and 900 from industry and the
universities - and that the board planned to complete its report by the
end of March. Although the history of the fire after it started had been
minutely reconstructed, the specific source of ignition had not been -
and might never be - determined. On 25 February, Seamans prepared a
memorandum for Webb, listing early recommendations by the board that the
Administrator could present to Congress:<p>

<blockquote>That combustible materials now used be replaced wherever
possible with non-flammable materials, that non-metallic materials that
<em>are</em> used be arranged to maintain fire breaks, that systems for
oxygen or liquid combustibles be made fire resistant, and that full
flammability tests be conducted with a mockup of the new
configuration.<p>

That a more rapidly and more easily operated hatch be designed and
installed.<p>

That on-the-pad emergency procedures be revised to recognize the
possibility of cabin fire.<a href =
"#source18"><b>18</b></a></blockquote><p>

The astronaut member of the Thompson Board assured NASA's top officials
that he would not have been afraid to enter the Grissom crew's
spacecraft that January day. Working with the board, however, Borman and
everyone else had come to realize the substantial hazards that had been
present but not recognized before the fire.<a href =
"#source19"><b>19</a></b><p>

As its final report was being put together, the review board recognized
that there had been ignorance, sloth, and carelessness, but the key word
in all the detailed information was &quot;oversight.&quot; No one, it
seemed, realized the extent of fire hazards in an overpressurized
oxygen-filled spacecraft cabin on the ground, according to the summary
report the board issued on 5 April:<p>

<blockquote>Although the Board was not able to determine conclusively
the specific initiator of the Apollo 204 fire, it has identified the
conditions which led to the disaster. . . : 1. A sealed cabin,
pressurized with an oxygen atmosphere. 2. An extensive distribution of
combustible materials in the cabin. 3. Vulnerable wiring carrying
spacecraft power. 4. Vulnerable plumbing carrying a combustible and
corrosive coolant. 5. Inadequate provisions for the crew to escape. 6.
Inadequate provisions for rescue or medical assistance.<p>

Having identified the conditions that led to the disaster, the Board
addressed itself to the question of how these conditions came to exist.
Careful consideration of this question leads the Board to the conclusion
that in its devotion to the many difficult problems of space travel, the
Apollo team failed to give adequate attention to certain mundane but
equally vital questions of crew safety. The Board's investigation
revealed many deficiencies in design and engineering, manufacture and
quality control.<a href = "#source20"><b>20</b></a> </blockquote><p>

The Thompson Board report came to almost 3,000 pages; divided into 14
booklets, it made up a stack about 20 centimeters high. The six
appendixes were: (A) the minutes of the board's own proceedings; (B)
eyewitness statements and releases; (C) the Operations Handbook for
spacecraft 012; (D) final reports of all 21 panels; (E) a brief summary
of management and organization; and (F) a schedule of visible
evidence.<p>

But even before the board issued its report, its conclusions were
essentially already public. For instance, a month after the fire Mueller
had admitted to Congress that, after six safe years of manned flight
experience, it was now obvious that NASA's approach to fire prevention
had been wrong. Minimizing the possibility of ignition had not been
enough. Safeguards against the spreading of any fire must also be
developed. Since it would be nearly impossible to design equipment that
would protect the crews both on the ground and in space,<a href =
"#explanation1"><b>*</b></a> any nonmetallic, and perhaps flammable,
materials would have to be carefully screened. In particular, the
&quot;four Fs&quot; - fabrics, fasteners, film, and foams - required
further investigation. Wiring, plumbing, and packaging must be
reevaluated, even if it meant reviving the old debate about a one-
versus two-gas environmental control system.<a href =
"#source21"><b>21</a></b><p>

As they delved deeper into the reasons behind the tragedy, NASA
officials were confronted by some &quot;skeletons in their closet.&quot;
Senator Walter F. Mondale raised the question of negligence on the part
of management and the prime contractor by introducing the &quot;Phillips
report&quot; of 1965-1966. The implication was that NASA had been
thinking of replacing North American. But the charges were vague; and,
for the next several weeks, no one seemed to know exactly what the
Phillips report was. In fact, Webb at first denied that there was such a
report. <a href = "ch8-3.html"><b>(See Chapter 8.)</b></a> Mondale also
alluded to a document by a North American employee, Thomas R. Baron,
that was critical of the contractor's operations at the Cape.<p>

Baron was a rank and file inspector at Kennedy from September 1965 until
November 1966, when he asked for and received a leave of absence. He had
made observations; had collected gossip, rumor, and critical comments
from his fellow employees; and had written a set of condemnatory notes.
He had detailed, but not documented, difficulties with persons, parts,
equipment, and procedures. Baron had observed the faults of a
large-scale organization and apparently had performed his job as a
quality inspector with a vengeance. He noted poor workmanship,
spacecraft 012 contamination, discrepancies with installations, problems
in the environmental control system, and many infractions of cleanliness
and safety rules.<p>

Baron passed on these and other criticisms to his superiors and friends;
then he deliberately let his findings leak out to newsmen. North
American considered his actions irresponsible and discharged him on 5
January 1967. The company then analyzed and refuted each of Baron's
charges and allegations. In the rebuttal, North American denied anything
but partial validity to Baron's wide-ranging accusations, although some
company officials later testified before Congress that about half of the
charges were well-grounded. When the tragedy occurred, Baron was
apparently in the process of expanding his 55-page paper into a 500-page
report.<p>

When his indictments were finally aired before Teague's subcommittee,
during a meeting at the Cape on 21 April, Baron's credibility was
impaired by one of his alleged informants, a fellow North American
employee named Mervin Holmburg. Holmburg denied knowing anything about
the cause of the accident, although Baron had told the committee that
Holmburg &quot;knew exactly what caused the fire.&quot; Holmburg
testified that Baron &quot;gets all his information from anonymous phone
calls, people calling him and people dropping him a word here and there.
That is what he tells me.&quot; Ironically, Baron and all his family
died in a car-train crash only a week after this exposure to
congressional questioning.<a href = "#source22"><b>22</a></b><p>

Beyond the Phillips and Baron reports, however, recollections of events
and warnings during the past six years made each Apollo manager wonder
if he had really done all in his power to prevent the tragedy. In March
1965, for instance, Shea and the crew systems people in Houston had
wrestled with the question of the one- or two-gas atmosphere and the
likelihood of fire - most of the studies were, admittedly, based on the
possibility of fire in space - and concluded that a pure oxygen system
was safer, less complicated,and lighter in weight. The best way to guard
against fire was to keep flammable materials out of the cabin. Hilliard
W. Paige of General Electric had, as a matter of fact, warned Shea about
the likelihood of spacecraft fires on the ground as recently as
September 1966; and, just three weeks before the accident, Medical
Director Charles Berry had complained that it was certainly harder to
eliminate hazardous materials from the Apollo spacecraft than it had
been in either Mercury or Gemini.<a href = "#source23"><b>23</a></b><p>

Although the Senate committee had begun its hearings while the board
investigation was in progress, the House subcommittee waited until the
final report was ready. By then, the Senate had touched on most of the
major issues. As expected, the exact cause of the fire in spacecraft 012
was never determined, but the analysis of all possibilities led to
specific corrective actions that eventually satisfied Congress.
Throughout the hearings, Borman, still wearing two hats - as an
astronaut and as a member of the Apollo 204 Review Board - was very
effective. In the course of his testimony, Borman reiterated that the
cause of the fire was oversight, rather than negligence or
overconfidence. Fire in flight, he said, had been a matter of grave
concern since the early days of aviation and the subject of numerous
studies. But the notion that a fire hazard was increased on the ground
by the use of flammable materials and an overpressure of pure oxygen had
never been seriously considered.<p>

On one occasion, when astronauts Walter Schirra, Slayton, Alan Shepard,
and James McDivitt had expressed their confidence in NASA's future
safety measures, Borman answered a congressman's doubts by saying:<p>

<blockquote>You are asking us do we have confidence in the spacecraft,
NASA management, our own training, and . . . our leaders. I am almost
embarrassed because our answers appear to be a party line. Everything I
said last week has been repeated by the people I see here today. The
response we have given is the same because it is the truth. . . . We are
trying to tell you that we are confident in our management, and in our
engineering and in ourselves. I think the question is really: Are you
confident in us?<a href = "#source24"><b>24</b></a> </blockquote><p>

When Borman made a plea on 17 April to stop the witch hunt and get on
with Apollo, both NASA and North American had responded to the
criticisms of the Thompson Board and of Congress. Top-level personnel
changes were direct outgrowths of the charges of negligence and
mismanagement: Everett E. Christensen at NASA Headquarters resigned as
Apollo mission director; George Low replaced Shea as Apollo Spacecraft
Program Manager in Houston; and William D. Bergen (formerly of the
Martin Company) took over from Harrison Storms as president of North
American's Space and Information Systems Division. Bergen brought with
him two associates from Martin: Bastian Hello to run the Florida
facility for North American and John P. Healy to manage the first manned
Block II command module at Downey. Healey was expected to set precedents
in guiding a nearly perfect spacecraft through the factory.<a href =
"#source25"><b>25</a></b><p>

Most North American officials weathered congressional criticism and
pointed out that they agreed, in part, with the formal findings and
recommendations of the Thompson Board.<a href =
"#explanation2"><b>**</b></a> But North American objected to the word
&quot;chronic&quot; in describing problems with the environmental
control system and defended its electrical wiring practices as
functional rather than beautiful. Concurring that the fire probably
started from an electrical spark somewhere near the environmental unit,
the manufacturers also agreed with NASA on why the fire spread:<p>

<blockquote>Not withstanding this emphasis on the potential problems
created by combustibles in the spacecraft, it can be seen in retrospect
that attention was principally directed to individual testing of the
material. What was not fully understood by either North American or NASA
was the importance of considering the fire potential of combustibles in
a system of all materials taken together in the position which they
would occupy in the spacecraft and in the environment of the
spacecraft.<a href = "#source26">`<b>26</b></a> </blockquote><p>

Leland Atwood and Dale Myers used charts to emphasize to Congress the
changes that the company intended to make in both construction and test
operations. North American would assign a spacecraft manager and a
personalized team to each vehicle, appoint an assistant program manager
whose only concern was safety, place additional controls on changes made
during modification and checkout phases, and assign personal
responsibility to specific inspectors. The company would also revise its
fabrication and inspection criteria; expand its quality standards,
issuing a handbook with better visual aids; install more protected
wiring and plumbing; and insist upon additional major inspections. Myers
then discussed fire-related hardware changes: the new unified hatch,
materials reevaluation, fluids and plumbing reassessment, electrical
system improvements, revised on-the-pad operations, and flammability
tests.<a href = "#source27"><b>27</a></b>

<p>

In Houston, Faget's engineering and development activity ran all sorts
of tests on materials and components, and Robert Gilruth sent Borman
with a Houston &quot;tiger team&quot; to Downey in mid-April.<a href =
"#explanation3"><b>***</b></a> The astronaut was to make on-the-spot
decisions on contractual changes for the unified hatch, better wiring
and plumbing techniques, and other improvements that had been planned
even before the accident. Borman's tiger team watched closely, lending
its assistance when necessary, as North American engineers went over the
spacecraft piece by piece.<a href = "#source28"><b>28</a></b><p>

What had happened to the command module, obviously, could just as well
happen to the lunar module. Immediately after the fire, Thomas J. Kelly
and a host of Grumman workers began a comprehensive review of materials
in the lunar lander. Low sent Robert L. Johnston, a materials expert, to
help Kelly's group. Grumman replaced nylon cloth in the spacecraft,
relying mostly on Beta fiber (an inorganic substance developed by the
Corning Glass Works, that would not catch fire nor produce toxic fumes).
Perhaps the most important application of this material was as
&quot;booties&quot; around circuit breakers, to lessen the possibilities
of electrical shorts. In other areas, Grumman worked on its forward
hatch, to ensure a crew exit within 10 seconds; the environmental
control system; and a cabin and exterior pressure equalization system.
All in all, the changes would add a three- to four-month delay in
deliveries to the schedule trouble the lander was in even before the
fire. Phillips sent a group headed by Roderick O. Middleton of Kennedy
to look into Grumman's quality control and inspection procedures.
Middleton's audit team completed its report in mid-May, giving Grumman
generally good marks in the manufacturing process.<a href =

In Washington, on 9 May, Webb was again called on the carpet by the
Senate committee. The Phillips report was again a major subject for
debate, this time in a context that made it appear that the NASA-North
American relationship was in danger of becoming a political football.
The very next day, however, congressional questioning began to wind
down. As Congressman John W. Wydler put it:<p>

<blockquote>Essentially the story of the Apollo accident is known to the
American people. We have admissions and statements about the things that
NASA . . . and . . . North American Aviation [were] doing wrong. . . .
But I want to say this to you, Mr. Webb. Over the past few years . . . I
probably have been one of the most critical members on this committee of
NASA. . . . It appeared to me . . . that you have had it too easy for
your own good from this committee. This is not a criticism being
directed at you or the Space Agency, but a criticism being directed
inwardly at the Congress and this committee. I feel right now that you
got less criticism than you deserved [in the past, but now] you are
getting more criticism than you deserve. I don't intend to add to it for
that reason.</blockquote><p>

Wydler did not really stop there, of course, but the investigation did
begin to fade away. NASA and North American began implementing the
technical recommendations. To some degree, the accident actually bought
time for some pieces of Apollo - the lunar module, the Saturn V, the
guidance and navigation system, the computers, and the mission
simulators - to catch up with and become adapted to the total
configuration.<a href = "#source30"><b>30</a></b><p>

Meanwhile, on 23 April 1967 the Soviet Union announced the launching of
Vladimir M. Komarov aboard a new spacecraft. <cite>Soyuz I</cite>
appeared to be functioning normally at first. On its second day of
flight, however, the craft began to tumble, and Komarov had to use more
attitude fuel than he wanted to get the ship under control. He tried to
land during his 17th circuit but could not get the proper orientation
for retrofire. Komarov succeeded in reentering on the 18th revolution,
but his parachute shroud lines entangled. The cosmonaut was killed on
impact. So both <cite>Soyuz I</cite> and Apollo 1 put their programs
through traumatic reassessments. No one found any consolation in a
&quot;rebalanced&quot; space race. In fact, Webb took the occasion to
emphasize the need for international cooperation by asking: &quot;Could
the lives already lost have been saved if we had known each other's
hopes, aspirations and plans? Or could they have been saved if full
cooperation had been the order of the day?&quot;<a href =
"#source31"><b>31</a></b>

<a name = "explanation1"><b>*</b></a> In August 1966, three fire
extinguishers, weighing only 5.7 to 6 kilograms, were evaluated for
spacecraft 012 and subsequent flights. The extinguisher selected would
be stowed on liftoff for the first manned flights. On later missions, it
would be mounted in brackets. All three used Freon FE 1301, a most
efficient extinguishing agent on the ground. Under space conditions,
however, the chemical worked more slowly, required a higher level of
saturation of the flammable materials, and, even worse, generated a gas
that might, in sufficient quantities, prove fatal to the crew. Other
chemicals would of course be tested, but this would take time.<p>
