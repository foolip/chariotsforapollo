<h2>1969: July</h2>

<p>

In the summer of 1968, a group led by John R. Sevier in Houston studied
hundreds of possible lunar landing sites. A lot was involved in setting
the lunar module down on the moon - keeping the vehicle stable; gauging
surface slopes and boulder distribution; controlling forward, lateral,
and vertical speeds during the final few seconds before committing to a
landing; and finally cutting off the engine at the proper instant. The
spacecraft was equipped to make an automatic, hands-off landing, but
analyses of site survey photographs indicated that in such a landing the
vehicle would overturn 7 out of 100 times. Sevier's group contended that
a manually controlled touchdown by the astronauts faced better odds.
Using a lunar surface model complete with craters and hills and
illuminated to match a particular time and date, the analysts
demonstrated that the pilots could recognize the high slopes and craters
in time to fly over and land beyond them and that there would be enough
fuel to do this. Many of the suggested areas were eliminated on the
basis of these studies; the list of candidate sites was pared to five
for Apollo 11. When Site 2, in the Sea of Tranquility,<a href =

1969, a waiting world watched and hoped that the space team's confidence
was warranted.<a href = "#source1"><b>1</b></a>

part of the moon in southwestern Mare Tranquillitatis. It was about 100
kilometers east of the rim of Crater Sabine and 190 west southwest of
Crater Maskelyne - latitude 0 degrees 43' 56&quot; north, longitude 23
degrees 38' 51&quot; east.<p>
