<P>For the 19th flight of American astronauts into space, Vice President Spiro 
T. Agnew, representing the new administration of Richard Nixon, sat in the 
firing control room viewing area on 3 March 1969. He and other guests listened 
to the countdown of the tall Saturn-Apollo structure several kilometers away at 
the edge of the Florida beach. Fully recovered from their stuffy heads and runny 
noses, McDivitt, Scott, and Schweickart lay in the mixed-atmosphere cabin of 
CSM-104. Breathing pure oxygen through the suit system, they tried to adjust an 
inlet valve that seemed to have two temperature ranges - too hot and too cold. 
That was their only problem. Less than one second after its scheduled 11:00 a.m. 
EST liftoff time, <CITE>Apollo 9</CITE> rumbled upward.<A 
href="#source19"><B>19</B></A>
<P>In Houston, where more than 200 newsmen had registered to cover the mission, 
Flight Director Eugene F. Kranz and Mission Director George H. Hage<A 
href="#explanation1"><B>*</B></A> 
watched the displays on their consoles while McDivitt and CapCom Stuart Roosa 
called off the events of the launch sequence. There were the usual vibrations 
but, on the whole, the Saturn V's S-IC stage gave the crew what McDivitt called 
"an old lady's ride" - very smooth. The big surprise came when its five engines 
stopped thrusting. Feeling as if they were being shoved back to the earth, the 
astronauts lurched forward, almost into the instrument panel. The S-II second 
stage engines then cut in and pressed them back into the couches. Everything 
went well until the seven-minute mark, when the old pogo problem popped up 
again. Although the oscillations were greater than those of Borman's flight, 
McDivitt's crew lodged no complaints. At 11 minutes 13 seconds from launch, the 
S-IVB third stage kicked itself and the two spacecraft into orbit 190 kilometers 
above the earth.<A 
href="#source20"><B>20</B></A> 

<P><IMG height=406 alt="Apollo 9 LM atop S-IVB" src="images/c297a.jpg" 
width=416>
<P><CITE>After reaching earth orbit, the crew separated from the Saturn V's 
S-IVB stage and turned the command module around to face the lunar module, still 
attached to the stage. Command module pilot Scott maneuvered the CM probe into 
the dish-shaped drogue on the LM and pulled out the lunar craft.</CITE> 
<P>
<HR>

<P>Upon reaching the orbital station, the trio remembered Borman's warning 
against jumping out of the couches too quickly and flitting about in the 
weightless cabin. The men avoided sudden head turns, made slow deliberate 
movements, took medication - and still felt dizzy. But they were able to go 
about their duties, checking instruments and extending the docking probe. After 
more than a circuit, 2 hours 43 minutes into the mission, Scott lit the 
pyrotechnics that separated the command and service modules from the S-IVB stage 
and began one of the critical steps in the lunar-orbit concept. He fired the 
thrusters and pulled the command ship away, turned the ship around, fired again, 
and drew near what he called the "big fellow." Then he noticed that the command 
module's nose was out of line with the lander's nose. Scott tried to use a 
service module thruster to turn left, but that jet was not operating. The crew 
then flipped some switches, which started the thruster working, and at 3 hours 2 
minutes the command module probe nestled into the lunar module drogue, where it 
was captured and held by the latches.<A 
href="#source21"><B>21</B></A>
<P>After docking, McDivitt and Schweickart began preparing for their eventual 
entry into the lunar module. First, they opened a valve to pressurize the tunnel 
between the two spacecraft. With Scott reading the checklist aloud, McDivitt and 
Schweickart removed the command module hatch and checked the 12 latches on the 
docking ring to verify the seal. Next they connected the electrical umbilical 
lines that would provide command module power to the lander while the vehicles 
were docked. McDivitt checked the drogue carefully and found no large scars. 
Meanwhile, Schweickart glanced out the spacecraft window and failed to see the 
lunar module in the darkness, which scared him. "Oh, my God!" he exclaimed, "I 
just looked out the window and the LM wasn't there." Scott laughed and said it 
would be "pretty hard [not to] have a LM out there . . . with Jim in the 
tunnel." McDivitt put the hatch back in place until time to transfer into the 
lander. About an hour later, an ejection mechanism kicked the docked spacecraft 
away from the S-IVB. <CITE>Apollo 9</CITE> backed away, and the Saturn third 
stage, after firing twice, headed for solar orbit.<A 
href="#source22"><B>22</B></A>
<P>McDivitt's crew then turned to another trailblazing task - firing the service 
module propulsion system. Astronauts had in the past used one vehicle to push 
another into higher orbit,<A 
href="#explanation2"><B>**</B></A> 
but never a craft as big as the lander. Some six hours into the mission, they 
made the first test burn, which lasted five seconds. Flight controllers in 
Houston considered this the most critical of the docked service module engine 
firings. Scott must have agreed with them, because he exclaimed, "The LM is 
still there, by God!" The engine had come on abruptly, McDivitt later said; with 
the tremendous mass, however, acceleration was very slow - it took the whole 5 
seconds to add 11 meters per second to the speed. Sixteen hours after this short 
burst, a second propulsion system ignition, lasting 110 seconds, included 
gimbaling (or swiveling) the engine to find out whether the guidance and 
navigation system's autopilot could steady the spacecraft. The autopilot stilled 
the motions within 5 seconds.<A 
href="#source23"><B>23</B></A>
<P>The crewmen grew more and more confident that they could handle their 
machines. And that was a good thing, since they next had to make a 280-second 
burn, to produce an added velocity of 783 meters per second. This lightened the 
service module's fuel load by 8,462 kilograms and made it easier to turn the 
vehicles with the reaction control jets. The firing also altered the flight path 
and raised the apogee of the orbit from 357 to 509 kilometers, to provide better 
ground tracking and lighting conditions during the rendezvous. Scott later 
reported that they had the sensation that the docked vehicles were bending 
slightly in the tunnel area, but the maneuver produced oscillations only 
one-third to one-half as large as they had expected from training. As the big 
engine fired, McDivitt commented, "SPS . . . is no sweat." The astronauts were 
growing so used to the propulsion system that they hardly mentioned its fourth 
burn. Perhaps they were thinking of their next trailblazing chore, when two of 
them would crawl into the lunar module and check out its systems.<A 
href="#source24"><B>24</B></A>
<P>After they woke in the morning<A 
href="#explanation3"><B>***</B></A> 
and ate breakfast, McDivitt and Schweickart put on their pressure suits. 
Schweickart suddenly vomited. Fortunately, he kept his mouth shut until he could 
reach a bag. Although he did not feel particularly nauseated, both he and 
McDivitt became slightly disoriented when getting into their suits. For a few 
seconds, they could not tell up from down, which gave them a queasy feeling. 
Scott, already dressed, removed the command module hatch, the probe, and the 
drogue from the tunnel so his colleagues could get into the lunar module. 
Schweickart slid easily through the 81-centimeter tunnel, opened the lunar 
module hatch, and went next door in the first intervehicular transfer in space. 
After he had flipped all the necessary switches, Schweickart reported that the 
lander was certainly noisy, especially its environmental control system.
<P>McDivitt followed Schweickart into the lunar module an hour later. Within a 
brief time, a television camera had been unstowed and their activities were 
being beamed to the earth. Then they shut themselves off from Scott by closing 
their hatch while he was sealing himself off from <CITE>Spider.</CITE> A key 
event in lunar missions would be the deployment of the landing gear. A second or 
two after Schweickart pushed the button, the lunar module's legs sprang smartly 
into place. After the vehicles separated, the lunar module would flip over so 
the command module pilot could make sure all four legs were in the proper 
position.
<P>Then Schweickart was sick again, and McDivitt asked for a private talk with 
the medical people. Although the news media were quickly informed of 
Schweickart's problem, this request for a "private" discussion was like waving a 
red flag, causing repercussions and a spate of unfriendly stories.<A 
href="#explanation4"><B>****</B></A> 
On this second occasion, the impulse to vomit came on just as suddenly as it 
had earlier, while Schweickart was busy flipping switches. Afterward, he felt 
much better and moved around the cabin normally, but he had lost his appetite 
for anything except liquids and fruits for the remainder of the voyage.<A 
href="#source25"><B>25</B></A>
<P>As soon as he was sure the systems were operating properly, McDivitt asked 
Scott to put the command module into neutral control, so he could check out the 
lunar module's steering system. McDivitt then operated the small thrusters to 
get the docked vehicles into the correct position for firing the lunar module's 
throttleable descent propulsion system. Seconds after starting the large descent 
engine, McDivitt shouted, "Look at that [attitude] ball; my God, we hardly have 
any errors." Twenty-six seconds later, at full thrust, he reported that errors 
were still practically nonexistent. In fact, things were going so smoothly that 
halfway through the 371.5-second exercise, the commander felt hungry - not an 
uncommon sensation with him. So he ate before crawling back into the command 
module. Schweickart stayed behind to shut everything down and straighten up the 
cabin before joining the others in <CITE>Gumdrop.</CITE> The lander appeared to 
be a dependable machine.<A 
href="#source26"><B>26</B></A>
<P>After Schweickart had vomited on two occasions, McDivitt was doubtful that 
the lunar module pilot would be able to handle his chores outside the 
spacecraft. The commander recommended to flight control that this exercise be 
limited to cabin depressurization. Flight control agreed that the extravehicular 
activity would consist of one daylight period, with Schweickart wearing the 
portable life support system and the lunar module umbilical hoses,<A 
href="#explanation5"><B>#</B></A> 
and with both the lunar module and command module hatches open. On the fourth 
day of flight, working his way into the lander to get it ready, Schweickart felt 
livelier than he had expected. By the time he had put on the backpack, McDivitt 
was ready to let him do more - to stand on the porch at least. Flight control 
told the commander to use his own judgment. So McDivitt fastened Schweickart to 
the nylon-cord tether that would keep him from floating away from the 
spacecraft.<A 
href="#source27"><B>27</B></A> 

<P align=center><IMG height=408 alt="Schweickart stands on LM porch"

<P>
<HR>

<P>Once Schweickart had entered this "third spacecraft," to become essentially a 
self-contained unit, flight control ran a communications check with 
<CITE>PLSS,</CITE> as they first called him. The four-way conversation - between 
<CITE>Spider, Gumdrop, PLSS,</CITE> and the Houston control center - was much 
clearer than they had expected. Lunar module depressurization also went 
smoothly. Schweickart could tell that his backpack was operating, since he could 
hear water gurgling while he watched his pressure indicator. He was quite 
comfortable. McDivitt had to use more force than he had anticipated to turn the 
hatch latch handle and more strength to swing the hatch inside. He was very 
careful to keep the door pushed back, fearing it might stick closed, leaving 
Schweickart outside.<A 
href="#source28"><B>28</B></A>
<P>
<P align=center><IMG height=403 alt="Scott standing in CM hatch"

<P><CITE>Scott, standing in the open hatch of CM Gumdrop, is photographed in 
turn by Schweickart.</CITE> 
<P>
<HR>

<P>Once the lunar module hatch was opened, Scott pushed the command module hatch 
outward. Schweickart, who now called himself <CITE>Red Rover</CITE> because of 
his rust-colored hair, enjoyed the view and did so well outside on the platform 
in the golden slippers that McDivitt decided to let him try out the handrails. 
Hanging on with one hand as he moved about, he took photographs and found that 
the handholds made everything easier than it had been in simulation, even in 
underwater training. He did not go over and visit Scott in the command module, 
but both pilots retrieved experiment samples from the spacecraft hulls. Scott 
and Schweickart also took pictures of each other, like tourists in a strange 
country. Originally scheduled to last more than two hours, the extravehicular 
period ended in less than one, partly because they did not want to tire 
Schweickart after his illness and partly because they had plenty to do to get 
ready for the next day's pathfinding activity, the key event of the entire 
mission: the separation and rendezvous of the lunar module and the command 
module. With the door closed and their life-sustaining outside equipment off, 
McDivitt and Schweickart recharged the backpack, tidied up the cabin, and 
returned to the command module.<A 
href="#source29"><B>29</B></A>
<P>On both occasions when they had transferred to the lander, the pilots had 
been behind the schedule. On 7 March, they got up an hour earlier than usual. 
They also obtained permission from flight control to move into the lunar module 
without helmets and oxygen hoses, which made it easier to go through the 
checklist and to set up the module for the coming maneuvers. Soon both 
spacecraft were ready. When Scott tried to release the lunar module, however, it 
hung on the capture latches. He punched the button again and the lander dropped 
away. McDivitt watched the widening distance between the two craft. 
<CITE>Spider</CITE> then made a 90-degree pitch and a 360-degree yaw maneuver, 
so Scott could see its legs.<A 
href="#source30"><B>30</B></A> 

<P align=center><IMG height=406 alt="LM in orbit" src="images/c297d.jpg"

<P><CITE>McDivitt and Schweickart show Spider's landing gear to Scott before

to the earth far beneath.</CITE> 
<P>
<HR>

<P>After drifting around within 4 kilometers of the command module for 45 
minutes, McDivitt fired the lunar module's descent propulsion engine to increase 
the distance to nearly 23 kilometers. The motor was smooth until it achieved 
10-percent thrust. When McDivitt advanced the throttle to 20 percent, the engine 
chugged noisily. McDivitt stopped throttling and waited. Within seconds, the 
chugging stopped. He accelerated to 40 percent before shutting down and had no 
more problems. McDivitt and Schweickart checked the systems and fired the 
descent engine again, to a 10-percent throttle setting; this time it ran evenly. 
As they moved off in a nearly circular orbit 23 kilometers above the command 
module, they had no trouble seeing <CITE>Gumdrop,</CITE> even after the distance 
stretched to 90 kilometers. From the command module, Scott could spot the lander 
as far away as 160 kilometers with the help of a sextant. Estimating distances 
was difficult, but the radar furnished accurate figures.
<P>This new orbit, higher than that of the command ship, created the paradox 
associated with orbital mechanics of speeding up to go slow. Being higher above 
the earth (i.e., farther out from it) than the command module, the lander took 
longer to circle the globe. <CITE>Spider</CITE> gradually moved away, trailing 
185 kilometers behind <CITE>Gumdrop.</CITE> To begin the rendezvous, McDivitt 
and Schweickart flipped their craft over and fired the thrusters against the 
flight path to slow their speed enough to drop below the command module's 
orbital path. Below and behind the command module, they would begin to catch up. 
They fired the pyrotechnics to dump the descent stage and leave it behind. The 
firing produced a cloud of debris and caused their blinking tracking light to 
fail. McDivitt commented that staging was "sort of a kick in the fanny . . . but 
it went all right."<A 
href="#source31"><B>31</B></A> 
The distance between the lander and the command module soon shortened to 124 
kilometers. McDivitt blipped the ascent engine for three seconds to circularize 
their orbit and begin a chase that would last for more than two hours. As the 
gap between the two craft narrowed, McDivitt spotted a very small 
<CITE>Gumdrop</CITE> at 75 kilometers.
<P>About an hour after the ascent engine firing, McDivitt and Schweickart lit 
off their spacecraft's thrusters. "It looks like the Fourth of July," McDivitt 
commented, and Scott responded that he could see them very clearly. When the 
thrusters stopped, however, <CITE>Spider,</CITE> without its tracking light, was 
hard for Scott to spot. At that point, remembering the problem they had breaking 
away, McDivitt told Scott to make sure the command module was ready for docking. 
As he approached the other craft, the commander turned his machine in all 
directions so Scott could inspect its exterior. More than six hours after 
leaving the command module, McDivitt settled the lander firmly back into place 
and then reported, "I have capture." The 12 latches on the docking ring caught 
the lunar module and held it fast. Another stretch of the trail to the moon had 
been blazed. The lunar module could leave the command module, find its way back 
to it, and dock safely.<A 
href="#source32"><B>32</B></A>
<P>Even before crawling back into the command module, McDivitt said he was tired 
and ready for a three-day holiday. Another 140 hours would pass before touchdown 
in the Atlantic, but the crew had achieved more than 90 percent of the mission 
objectives. There were still things to do, such as making more service module 
engine burns (a total of eight throughout the flight) and jettisoning the ascent 
stage. Ground control radioed a firing signal to park the lunar module in a 
6,965- by 235-kilometer orbit. The crew watched the departing craft a while and 
then settled down to the more mundane tasks of checking systems, conducting 
navigation sightings, and taking pictures.<A 
href="#source33"><B>33</B></A>
<P>After 151 revolutions in 10 days, 1 hour, and 1 minute, <CITE>Apollo 9</CITE> 
splashed safely down in the Atlantic, northeast of Puerto Rico, on 13 March 
1969, completing a 6-million-kilometer flight that had cost an estimated $340 
million. Less than an hour later, the crew was deposited, by helicopter, aboard 
the carrier U.S.S. <CITE>Guadalcanal.</CITE> Then the debriefings and 
celebrations began. At a ceremony in Washington, with an address by Vice 
President Agnew, lunar module development leaders Carroll Bolender of the Manned 
Spacecraft Center and Llewellyn Evans of Grumman were given the NASA Exceptional 
Service Medal and NASA Public Service Award, respectively. NASA officials were 
stimulated by the path-breaking voyage of <CITE>Apollo 9.</CITE> They were now 
ready for the final rehearsal, a mission that would take Apollo back to the 
vicinity of the moon.<A
