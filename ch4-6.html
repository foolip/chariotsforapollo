<h1>NASA Adjustments for Apollo</h1>

<p>

In mid-1962, Washington program planners spelled out in detail the
interrelations of Apollo and the total space program. The agency's
unmanned satellites and space probes, especially Ranger and Surveyor,
would have to focus on the lunar mission, since the most pressing need
was for accurate information about the space environment such as
meteoroid and radiation hazards and the lunar surface.<a href =
"#source66"><b>66</b></a> Subordination of unmanned scientific programs
to the manned programs brought considerable criticism during the next
few years.<p>

NASA leadership was confronted during the summer and fall of 1962 with
the dual tasks of informing Congress of the status of Apollo and of
fitting its fiscal plans to the lunar-rendezvous approach. Defending
Apollo's budget request for fiscal 1963 before the Senate Committee on
Appropriations on 10 August 1962, Webb and Low reiterated that technical
considerations had been important in choosing that approach, but so had
costs. Lunar rendezvous for Apollo, although not lessening the agency's
needs for the upcoming year, would be cheaper in the long run. But NASA
must get started on both the lunar vehicle and a C-IB version of the
Saturn booster, Webb pointed out, to develop and test rendezvous
procedures in earth orbit before attempting them in lunar orbit.<a href

In late 1962 and early 1963, financial resources for NASA were
uncertain, particularly the funds needed for development of the lunar
module. Houston needed to know when the money would be available. On 9
October, Holmes asked Seamans to request a supplemental appropriation
from Congress, but Seamans refused. For the next year and a half, the
fiscal 1963 and 1964 funds, set at $2.058 billion and $3.402 billion,
would cover research and development and construction of facilities.
This should be enough, Seamans said, to keep on schedule and meet a 1967
landing date.<a href = "#source68"><b>68</a></b><p>

On 21 November 1962, Webb, Holmes, and others met with the President to
explore the possibility of an Apollo landing earlier than 1967 and to
discuss NASA's budget. Kennedy asked the Administrator for a policy
statement on the priority of the moon landing within the overall
civilian space effort. On 30 November, in a lengthy letter, Webb
replied: &quot;The objective of our national space program is to become
pre-eminent in all important aspects of this endeavor and to conduct the
program in such a manner that our emerging scientific, technological,
and operational competence in space is clearly evident.&quot; Apollo,
the largest single project within NASA, consuming three-fourths of the
agency's resources, was &quot;being executed with the utmost
urgency&quot; and was expected to &quot;provide a clear demonstration to
the world of our accomplishments in space.&quot;<p>

Although it had the highest priority within NASA, the manned lunar
landing program alone would not achieve superiority in space, Webb
continued. &quot;We [must] pursue an adequate well-balanced space
program in all areas. . . .&quot; He advised against canceling or
curtailing space science and technology development programs merely to
funnel these funds to Apollo, although that money, some $400 million,
was just the additional amount needed by Apollo for 1963. NASA's top
officials were concerned, he said, that attempts to get a budget
supplement might jeopardize appropriations for coming years and possibly
leave the agency open to charges of cost overruns and poor management.
&quot;The funds already appropriated,&quot; Webb affirmed, &quot;permit
us to maintain a driving, vigorous program in the manned space flight
area aimed at a target date of late 1967 for the lunar landing.&quot;<a

Although a steady flow of money during the succeeding years was
essential to the success of Apollo, it was not the major concern in late
1962. The lunar module contractor had been selected, but there was still
a lot of work to be done. And the lander was, potentially, the pacing
item - the factor that would determine <cite>when</cite> the United
States might land astronauts on the moon.
