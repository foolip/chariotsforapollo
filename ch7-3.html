<h1>Lunar Module Refinement</h1>

<p>

Lunar module activities also focused on configuration control,
schedules, and funds in 1965. J. Thomas Markley, program control chief,
directed the Apollo engineers to be more conservative in their proposals
to the Configuration Control Panels. Changes in the spacecraft must
correct design flaws, not improve hardware. But stemming the flow of
changes in the lunar module was not an easy matter; many were required
because of its mission.<a href = "#source12"><b>12</b></a>

An example was the installation of frangible probes on the base of each
foot pad to tell the crew the lander was a meter and a half above the
surface and to switch off the descent motor. If the motor were still
firing when the craft touched down, the engine nozzle would be damaged,
landing stability might be affected, and the ascent stage might be
impaired by debris kicked up by the engine exhaust.<a href =
"#source13"><b>13</b></a><p>

One configuration issue, a carry-over from 1963-1964, remained
unresolved throughout 1965 - whether to substitute an optical tracking
system for the complex, heavy, and expensive rendezvous radar. In
February 1965, the Configuration Control Board deleted the radar from
the command module and added flashing lights to the lander. If the lone
crewman in the command ship had to perform the rendezvous, he would use
onboard optics, a ranging capability, and the VHF communications link
between the spacecraft, which would also act as backups if the lander's
radar failed.<a href = "#source14"><b>14</b></a><p>

In mid-March, Cline W. Frasier of the Guidance and Control Division
suggested replacing the rendezvous radar in the lander with an optical
system, as well. Consisting of a star tracker in the lunar module, a
xenon strobe light on the command module, and a hand-held sextant for
the lander's pilot, the substitute would offer two advantages: a weight
reduction of 40 kilograms and a cost saving of 30 million.<a href =
"#source15"><b>15</b></a><p>

The Apollo office, hesitant to take such a step, decided to pursue
parallel development. In mid-April, Grumman was instructed to design the
lander to accept either system and to slow down RCA's radar development
program. Radar-tracker studies at the Manned Spacecraft Center would be
completed by September, and a contractor would be selected to design the
tracker. William A. Lee in Shea's office protested holding back RCA; the
delay would force the deletion of the radar from the first and second
landers, to be used on earth-orbital missions. This, said Lee, would be
a violation of the all-up concept of flying only complete spacecraft.
Changes in the radar program would be justified, he concluded, solely<p>

<blockquote>by the implicit assumption that we will cancel the program
eventually. The logic of this is very questionable, since it clearly
says that the money being spent on this program is being wasted
deliberately. We should either pursue the radar in a manner which would
permit its use on the LEM, or we should cancel it. I can find no middle
ground. . . . The small number of earth-orbital LEM flights can be
justified only if we adhere rigorously to the ground rules of all-up
flights and qualification prior to flight. It is too early in the LEM
program to consider compromising these requirements, and to do so for
budgetary reasons will almost certainly prove to be false economy.<a
href = "#source16"><b>16</b></a></blockquote><p>

In August, Houston amended its contract with AC Electronics to include
the optical tracker as government-furnished equipment. Grumman grumbled
but kept the spacecraft design flexible. Two months later, MSC's
Assistant Director for Flight Crew Operations Donald Slayton objected to
the tracker because of its limitations in determining range and
range-rate (approaching and departing speeds) data and the lack of
experience in using the instruments. If an immediate choice had to be
made, Slayton said, choose the radar. At the end of the year, Mueller,
Shea, and Robert C. Duncan set up what they called a &quot;rendezvous
sensor olympics&quot; to be completed in the spring of 1966. If either
system lagged, the decision would be obvious; if both were successful,
Duncan's division would recommend a choice; if both failed, there would
be a lot of work ahead.<a href = "#source17"><b>17</b></a><p>

The optical tracker's lighter weight was attractive, since weight was an
important factor in 1965. The lander had gained even more weight during
the early months of the year than the command and service modules. In
May, Shea persuaded Mueller to approve an increase in lander weight to
14,850 kilograms, including crew and equipment. In June, Harry L.
Reynolds warned Owen Maynard that it would be difficult to keep the
spacecraft below even that figure. All that summer, the warnings
continued. Caldwell Johnson wrote Shea in August that the lander might
get too heavy to do its job. The next month Shea asked Houston
management for help in solving the problem. He also formed a Weight
Control Board (headed by himself to act on reduction proposals.<a href =
"#source18"><b>18</b></a><p>

Really worried now, Grumman launched a two-pronged attack known as
&quot;Scrape&quot; and &quot;SWIP.&quot; Scrape meant just what the word
implies, searching the structure for every chance to shave bulk off
structural members. But SWIP Super Weight Improvement Program was
Grumman's real war against weight.<p>

Grumman project engineer Thomas J. Kelly led a SWIP team of a dozen
experts in structures, mass property, thermodynamics, and electronics,
whose task was to second-guess the whole design. This same team had
recently and successfully shaved weight off the F-111B aircraft, and it
knew what a tough job it was up against. When the SWIP campaign started,
the engineering design was 95 percent complete. So designers pored over
already approved drawings, looking for ways to lighten the craft.
Grumman also pressured Houston officials to keep all
government-furnished equipment for the lander within the specified
weights. And Bethpage scrutinized parts supplied by its subcontractors
and insisted that these weights be reduced wherever possible. Weekly
reports and monthly meetings between Bethpage and Houston turned into
forums for airing suggestions for further reductions and discussions of
what had been done. The first such review, held at Grumman on 3
September, revealed that 45 kilograms had already been whittled from the
structure by Scrape. The more extensive SWIP plan was outlined - what
had been started, what was planned, and what would be expected by way of
evaluation and cooperation from Houston's Apollo subsystem managers.<a
href = "#source19"><b>19</b></a><p>

By the end of 1965, Scrape and SWIP had pruned away 1,100 kilograms,
providing a comfortable margin below the control weight limit. One of
the more striking changes to come from this drive for a lighter
spacecraft was the substitution of aluminum-mylar foil thermal blankets
for rigid heatshields. The gold wrapping characteristic of the lander's
exterior saved 50 kilograms.<a href = "#source20"><b>20</b></a><p>

Many of these weight-reducing changes made the lander so difficult to
fabricate, so fragile and vulnerable to damage, that it demanded great
care and skill by assembly and checkout technicians. Structural
components took on strange and complex shapes, requiring careful
machining to remove any excess metal - a costly and time-consuming
process even after vendors had been found who would make these odd
looking parts.<a href = "#explanation1"><b>*</b></a><a href = "

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name = "explanation1"><b>*</b></a> Arnold Whitaker described how the
fabrication group was caught in the squeeze between manufacturing
requirements and schedule pressures. At a program management meeting he
said that &quot;one of the fellows in manufacturing came in [with] a
light cardboard box. . . . He said, 'I'll show you why everything's
late.' And he dumped out a whole box of machined parts . . . , very
complex fittings [too thin to be even] reasonably heavy sheet metal -
but it wasn't any sheet metal, it was a complex machined fitting. And he
said 'Man, we never built parts like this before in any quantity like
this and every fitting on the LEM looks like this.' &quot;
