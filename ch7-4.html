<h1>The LEM Test Program: A Pacing Item</h1>

<p>

Houston reviewed Grumman's testing program during 1965 to make sure it
covered everything from small components to the big test articles. On 15
April Grumman began test-firing the ascent engine at White Sands.
Propulsion testing was also being conducted at Bell and STL. Although
engine firing programs were behind schedule, Houston expected better
performance shortly.<a href = "#source22"><b>22</b></a><p>

Six lunar test articles LTAs formed the backbone of the ground test
program. Bethpage shipped LTA-2 to Huntsville for vibration testing to
see if it could withstand launch pressures, and LTA-10 to Tulsa, to
check its fit in the adapter. LTA-1 was a &quot;house&quot; spacecraft,
used to iron out problems during fabrication, assembly, and checkout.
Three more LTAs were under construction: LTA-8 for thermal-vacuum
testing in Houston and LTAs 3 and 5 for combined structural shakings,
vibrations, and engine firings.<a href = "#source23"><b>23</b></a><p>

Flight test plans for the early production landers were flexible to
accommodate schedule differences with the command module. LEM-1
naturally received the lion's share of attention, since Grumman had to
get it ready for an unmanned &quot;LEM-alone&quot; mission
(Apollo-Saturn 206A). LEM-1 would have to be ready at least three months
before the Block II command module, however, or its first mission would
be part of a test of the combined spacecraft.<a href =
"#source24"><b>24</b></a><p>

But Grumman was moving slowly. In the spring of 1965, John H. Disher of
NASA's Washington Apollo office told Shea he believed LEM-1 would be a
year late, making the lander a pacing item. Many factors contributed to
LEM-1's inertia, but ground testing topped the list. And the trouble in
ground testing was getting equipment ready to make the tests. Grumman's
old bugaboo - ground support equipment (GSE) - had reared its ugly head.
The significance of GSE shortages was not lost on Washington. At a
program review on 20 April, Mueller told Houston managers to identify
all lander GSE, along with the date it would be needed, as &quot;sort of
a thermometer&quot; to bring the weaknesses in the system to Grumman
management's attention.<a href = "#source25"><b>25</b></a><p>

In mid-May, Grumman officials looked at possible launch dates for the
first vehicle but could decide nothing definite because of a pinch in
fiscal year 1966 funding. Hardware production had to be cut back in an
attempt to absorb some of the loss. In July, Houston directed Bethpage
to delete LTA-4, a vibration test article, and two flight test articles
(FTAs). To replace the FTAs, two LTAs would be refurbished when they
finished ground tests. After trials with scale and full-sized models had
been run at Langley and elsewhere, Houston also canceled a landing gear
test model as an unnecessary expense.<a href =
"#source26"><b>26</b></a><p>

Grumman, at a program review on 6 July, then asked NASA to relax the
rules on qualification testing and to permit delivery to the Cape of
vehicles not fully equipped. Shea rejected this suggestion, ordering his
subsystem managers to make sure that only all-up landers left the
Grumman plant. Problems with some of the subsystems were a factor in
this request. Bell in particular was having trouble with the redesigned
injectors and tank bladders for the ascent engine, and manufacturing
problems were harassing Hamilton Standard's environmental control
system. Subsystem manager Richard E. Mayo asked Donald Sullivan (head of
a manufacturing unit in the Apollo office) to find out what was wrong.
When he visited the Windsor Locks plant, Sullivan noted that, although
Hamilton Standard was turning out high-quality parts, good solid
management in assembling and integrating the system was lacking.<a href
= "#source27"><b>27</b></a><p>

Electrical and electronics gear, where design changes persisted
throughout 1965, was also lagging. The abort sensor assembly (part of
the abort guidance system), for example, was redesigned to incorporate
continuous thermal control, a programmable memory for the computer, and
a data-entry-display assembly. In mid-August R. Wayne Young, who had
succeeded William Rector as the lander's project officer, ordered
Grumman project manager Robert Mullaney to stop making changes if the
present system could do the job.<a href = "#source28"><b>28</b></a><p>

Program spending began to equal schedules in importance. Just as the
lander got rolling toward flight hardware production, it was caught in
the budgetary squeeze imposed by Congress. Grumman had to shoulder most
of the burden in holding expenses down. Expenditures had risen
dramatically - from $135 million in fiscal 1964 to an estimated $350
million for 1966 - as Apollo funding reached its crisis during spring
and summer 1965. Grumman's fiscal discipline lagged in technical
problem-solving, subcontracting, and cost and schedule performance. To
push the contractor toward a solution, Houston decided it was time to
convert Grumman's cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to an incentive
agreement. With incentives to meet and penalties to face if they were
not met, Grumman could be expected to overcome these deficiencies.<a
href = "#source29"><b>29</b></a><p>

The drive for incentive contracting had started in Washington in 1962,
when NASA Associate Administrator Robert Seamans and John H. Rubel of
the Department of Defense discussed the possibility of converting NASA
contracts; defense procurement had called for incentive contracting,
whenever possible, for some time. The use of incentives rather than a
fixed fee, a turnabout in government dealings with industry, was
controversial. Critics pointed to lengthy delays in negotiations that
tied up engineers who otherwise could be working on program hardware and
a &quot;worsening of government-industry relations by causing
contractual bickering.&quot; Seamans and Mueller disagreed, insisting
that incentives placed more responsibility on the contractor. It did
take time and talent to work out the provisions, but it promised better
performance.<a href = "#source30"><b>30</b></a><p>

NASA had made only modest headway in this conversion during 1963 and
1964, but the agency intended to revamp the spacecraft contracts in
1965. Mueller wrote MSC Director Gilruth in April, stressing that
incentives must reflect schedules, cost, and performance, in that order.
To pave the way for incentive negotiations, Houston had to clear up a
number of unresolved contract change authorizations, which would be
reviewed by a board made up of Houston and Bethpage officials. The
review began in mid-March and ended in April with participants
deadlocked.<a href = "#source31"><b>31</b></a><p>

Houston and Bethpage kept trying to work out the individual contract
changes, but there was still no agreement in early June, after three
weeks of negotiations. Gilruth and Shea then discussed the impasse with
E. Clinton Towl, president of Grumman, and decided that it was pointless
to convert the contract at that time. Houston did impose a LEM
Management Plan on Grumman, hoping to control cost, schedules, and
performance. Until the last quarter of the year, Grumman would be
allowed to spend only $78 million, which was less than the contract
costs estimated during the unsuccessful review. If Grumman could stay
within this limit for a quarter, however, negotiations for the incentive
contract could resume.<a href = "#source32"><b>32</b></a><p>

In the interval Grumman concentrated on bringing its subcontractors into
line and converting its agreements with them into incentive contracts,
trying to demonstrate satisfactory control of the program. In September,
Grumman submitted a proposal for contract conversion to NASA.
Negotiations lasted until December and culminated in a contract with
enough incentives to spur the contractor to maintain costs and schedules
and to meet performance milestones. This arrangement, announced in
February 1966, carried the lander program through 1969 at a cost of
$1.42 billion. North American's incentive contract was also negotiated
(at an estimated $2.2 billion) during the latter half of 1965.<a href =
