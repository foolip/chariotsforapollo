<h1>Lunar Module</h1>

<p>

By 1966, the lunar module had achieved some degree of maturity. Grumman
had brought the lander out of the design phase and was trying to move it
in the production line. But there were indications that the contractor
was going to have problems. Control of in-house costs was fairly
efficient; the company's chief difficulties lay in overruns by its
subcontractors. R. Wayne Young, MSC's lunar module project officer,
estimated that by the end of June Grumman would spend $24 million more
than its allotted funds. Moreover, since late 1965 Grumman's scheduling
position had been shaky, with delays indicated virtually across the
board.<a href = "#source19"><b>19</a></b><p>

In light of these severe overruns, Houston sent representatives to
Bethpage to discuss cost-reduction measures. This conference produced a
list of items to either be reduced or chopped from the major
subcontractors. Meetings were then held with project manager at each of
the subcontractor plants to ram through cutbacks in requirements and
manpower. The reviews, lasting a month and a half, culminated in
tightened test procedures and performance requirements. To make sure
that cost-reduction measures were enforced, Grumman switched from
quarterly to monthly meetings with its subcontractors, inviting the
appropriate Houston subsystem manager to attend.<a href =
"#source20"><b>20</a></b><p>

Despite these actions, lunar module costs had not leveled off by late
spring. In-house cost control and forecasting had also begun to
deteriorate, aggravating the problems already encountered. Against this
backdrop, Gilruth met with Grumman's new president, Llewellyn J. Evans,
to discuss cost control and management of subcontractors. At Evans'
request, Gilruth sent a management analysis group to diagnose and
recommend ways to remedy the company's weaknesses. The NASA Management
Review Team, headed by Wesley L. Hjornevik of Houston, was composed of
members from both Houston and Washington.<a href =
"#source21"><b>21</a></b><p>

Hjornevik's team assembled at Bethpage in June. After a ten-day review,
the team reported its findings to company corporate officers and NASA
officials. Looking upon the Hjornevik team as a &quot;personal
management analysis staff,&quot; Evans promptly carried out most of its
recommendations on program management, costs, subcontractor control, and
ground support equipment. To make sure all orders were followed and all
decisions were relayed speedily to operating organizations, Grumman
installed Hugh McCullough at the head of a Program Control Office.
George F. Titterton moved from his vice-presidential suite to the
factory building that housed most of the spacecraft's managerial and
engineering staff, thus ensuring a high degree of corporate-level
supervision.<a href = "#source22"><b>22</a></b><p>

To bring about the kind of cost forecasting and control that NASA
wanted, Grumman adopted &quot;work packages&quot; - breaking the program
down into manageable segments, with strict cost budgets, and assigning
managers to ride herd on each package. By linking tasks to manpower,
program managers could better judge and control work in progress. This
approach was a real departure from the commodity-oriented approach used
by Grumman until that time. Shea watched these operations closely and on
19 September expressed his belief to Evans that the work packages could
control costs and might even effect some modest reductions. In the next
two months, however, costs still exceeded budgets in some areas. Unless
discipline were enforced, Shea warned Titterton on 18 November, the work
packages could turn into so many worthless scraps of paper rather than
effective management tools.<a href = "#source23"><b>23</a></b><p>

Hjornevik's team also discovered that no one person had been assigned
responsibility for overall subcontract supervision. As a result, this
whole area suffered from splintered authority. Grumman appointed Brian
Evans to the newly created position of Subcontract Manager, reporting
directly to Program Director Joseph G. Gavin, Jr. Evans then assembled a
staff of project managers and assigned each to a major subcontract, with
jurisdiction over costs, schedules, and technical performance. The
strengthened structure was a welcome tonic; hardware deliveries improved
and subsystem qualification moved ahead. Titterton also instituted
quarterly meetings with presidents of the major subcontractor firms,
similar to those held by Mueller for NASA's prime Apollo contractors.<a
href = "#source24"><b>24</a></b><p>

The weaknesses in ground checkout equipment, which had been a millstone
around the contractor's neck since the early days of the program, had
developed because Grumman leaders simply had not recognized the
immensity of the task. In February 1966 Phillips had pointed out to Shea
that this equipment had paced the start of propulsion system testing at
White Sands, had hampered in-house activity at Bethpage, and threatened
to delay operational readiness of checkout and launch facilities at
Kennedy Space Center.<a href = "#explanation1"><b>*</b></a> Shea replied
that Grumman had put checkout equipment engineering and manufacturing on
a 56-hour work week and was adding manpower to do the job.<a href =
"#source25"><b>25</a></b><p>

Despite Shea's reassurances and Grumman's attempts at remedial actions,
the system failed to improve measurably. Grumman had made progress in
engineering design, which was about 80 percent complete; the bottleneck
was in fabrication. Phillips and Mueller became thoroughly alarmed. They
suggested that Grumman purchase components for the system from General
Electric and other vendors who were having more success in the field.
Subsequently, Grumman did put a variety of ground support items up for
competitive bid.<a href = "#source26"><b>26</a></b><p>

At Bethpage, the Hjornevik team's difficulty in assessing the ground
support equipment problem hinged on the fact that Grumman did not have a
coordinated plan. The team suggested that Grumman devote more attention
to specific areas such as deadlines for drawing releases, an intensified
production effort, and a daily status review by program management.
Llewellyn Evans named John Coursen to oversee ground-support-equipment
manufacturing and set aside a separate building for the fabrication
workers, whose numbers had grown considerably. Procurement was also
strengthened, with Robert Brader heading a staff of a dozen purchasing
people. And, finally, a &quot;GSE command post&quot; was established to
track day-by-day progress.<a href = "#source27"><b>27</a></b><p>

Actions at Bethpage were complemented by moves in Houston. In mid-July,
Wayne Young appointed a team to meet with Grumman every month to assess
status and tackle problems. At the end of the summer, with the last
Gemini flight mission scheduled before the end of the year, Charles
Mathews and William Lee shipped some surplus Gemini checkout items to
Bethpage.<a href = "#source28"><b>28</b></a> Collectively, these
measures brought a dramatic turnaround in Grumman's checkout equipment
progress. As Gavin later observed: &quot;The tide was turned in
midsummer. We were effectively on schedule in mid-october.&quot;<a href
= "#source29"><b>29</a></b><p>

Successfully overhauling management practices and fighting rising costs
were commendable accomplishments, but the lunar module faced problems in
other areas that were equally dangerous to Apollo. Downey and the
command module had been the big technical worry during 1965, Shea said
at a meeting in San Augustine, Texas. The lander, which had begun the
program a year late, must not be allowed to stumble into the same
pitfalls. Echoing Shea's sentiments, William Lee commented that Apollo
would be in deep trouble if the lunar module followed the pattern of
Gemini and the command module.<a href = "#source30"><b>30</b></a><p>

A significant hurdle vaulted about mid-1966 was the final solution of
the long-overdue radar-optical-tracker question, the last of the
lander's subsystems to be settled. Engineers in the Manned Spacecraft
Center's Apollo office and in Robert E. Duncan's Guidance and Control
Division had promoted an &quot;olympics&quot; - a contest that pitted
the radar against the tracker - and performance trials took place in the
spring of 1966. After tests and presentations by competing contractors
RCA and Hughes Aircraft Company, a review board chose the RCA radar.
Although both systems could be developed within the same time and cost
($14 million), the radar had more operational flexibility than the less
versatile tracker. The radar was heavier, but the weight had little
influence on the choice, because of Grumman's weight-reduction program
of the previous year.<p>

Perhaps the decisive factor in the selection was the outspoken
preference of the astronauts. When asked by Duncan to support the
olympics, Donald Slayton stated forthrightly: &quot;The question is not
which system can be manufactured, packaged, and qualified as flight
hardware at the earliest date; it is which design is most operationally
suited to accomplishing the lunar mission.&quot; In light of recent
experience, Slayton and Russell L. Schweickart, the astronauts'
representative on the evaluation board, believed that mission planning
should make maximum use of Gemini rendezvous procedures and orbital
techniques. This should include, they said, &quot;an independent,
onboard source of range/range rate information . . . with accuracy on
the order of that provided by the existing LEM rendezvous radar.&quot;
So Grumman, which had slowed down radar development, shifted RCA back
into high gear.<a href = "#source31"><b>31</a></b><p>

The lunar module engines, too, were still having technical troubles,
troubles that seemed to defy solution, although none of them were grave
enough to threaten eventual success. For the descent engine, these
included rough burning; excessive eroding of the combustion chamber
throat; burning of the throttle mechanism pintle tip, where fuel and
oxidizer met and combustion began; and difficulty in getting presumably
identical engines to operate alike.<p>

Design engineers at the Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge (TRW) Systems Group<a
href = "#explanation2"><b>**</b></a> made several changes in the pintle
tip, the most significant being a switch to columbium to improve thermal
characteristics. Other revisions included removing a turbulence ring
around the interior of the chamber and realigning the flow pattern of
the fuel that cooled the sides of the chamber wall. Although
qualification testing was delayed six months, the problems seemed to be
solved.<a href = "#source32"><b>32</a></b><p>

Ascent engine technical problems were more fundamental. Bell was plagued
by fabrication and welding difficulties and by severe gouging in the
ablative lining of the thrust chamber. The injector, which had been
fitted with baffles to combat combustion instability encountered during
the shaped-charge bomb testing, was also a culprit. After an engineering
review and resulting design revisions, including strengthening of the
weld areas, Houston suggested that Bell begin work on a backup model.
That would be expensive, but something had to be done. Subsequently, an
improved injector demonstrated better burning characteristics. Late in
1966, however, another worry cropped up.<p>

At a Manned Spacecraft Center senior staff meeting on 4 November, Max
Faget reported two instances of unstable combustion: one, during a
firing test at White Sands, with a flat-face injector; the second at
Bell, during a bomb test for design verification of a supposedly
improved, baffled model. In both tests, damages had been extensive. At
this point in the program, with the first two flight vehicles already
late for delivery, these failures were ominous.<a href =
"#source33"><b>33</a></b><p>

Schedule difficulties for the lunar module were nothing new, of course.
Grumman had been under the gun from the very beginning, when the mode
selection made the lander a late starter in Apollo. But during the
summer and autumn of 1966, schedules became crucial. In July, every
vehicle on the production line through LM-4 was late. Moreover, because
of tardy deliveries by vendors, a serious bottleneck was shaping up in
the assembly of LM-1. By late November, however, the earlier remedial
actions seemed to be having some good effect and this continual slippage
appeared to have slowed. At a briefing for Olin Teague's congressional
Subcommittee on NASA Oversight in Houston on 6 October, Shea had said
that he expected the first lunar module to be shipped early in 1967.<a
href = "#source34"><b>34</a></b><p>

By the end of the year, LM-1 and LM-2 were in the test stands at
Bethpage, and LM-3 through LM-7 were in various stages of fabrication
and equipment installation. But the coming of the new year did not yield
the progress Shea had looked for the previous October. Toward the end of
January, it was revealed that LM-1 would not reach the Cape in February,
as expected.<a href = "#source35"><b>35</b></a> In short, the moon
landing might be delayed because the lander was not ready. But the
mission planners could not wait for the Apollo engineers to iron out all
the problems. They had to plan for a landing in 1969 and hope that the
hardware would catch up with them.

<a name = "explanation1"><b>*</b></a> After attending a lunar module
status review at Bethpage on 18 May, Harold G. Russell, Special
Assistant to Phillips for Operational Readiness, expressed his mounting
concern about Grumman's chances for meeting the operational readiness
dates for facilities at the Cape. The company was reporting delays of
two and a half months in support of LM-1, but, Russell told Phillips,
&quot;from an analysis of the GAEC internal reporting system (if they
really have such a system), the slippages may be worse than they are
reporting. I seriously question the GAEC management visibility into
their critical problem areas.&quot;<p>
