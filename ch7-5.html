<h1>The Manned Factor</h1>

<p>

While various organizations struggled to get the spacecraft through the
development phase, human factors experts concentrated on the progress of
the spacesuit and the selection of astronauts. For some time, the suit
had met turmoil, schedule delays, and technical problems. Early in 1962,
Houston had forced a marriage between Hamilton Standard (for a portable
life support system) and the International Latex Corporation (for the
suit). Hamilton Standard managed the whole system, known as the
extravehicular mobility unit. From the beginning, the arrangement proved
unworkable.

lunar surface.</cite>

Just how unworkable was revealed in the spring of 1964, when prototype
suits used in the command module mockup review turned out to be
incompatible with the Apollo spacecraft cabin. NASA officials had to
fall back on Gemini suits for Block I earth-orbital flights. This
substitution gave Hamilton Standard and International Latex a chance to
straighten out their problems, but borrowed time did not spell progress.
Early in 1965, Hamilton Standard announced that its system manager for
the backpack had begun in-house work on backup components for the suit
(such as helmets and suit joints). The company had thus become a
competitor of its own subcontractor. In February, Hamilton Standard
reported that it intended to cancel the International Latex contract,
citing poor performance, late deliveries, and cost overruns. Houston
concurred.<p>

Houston had also started some remedial actions. In January, David Clark
Company, maker of the Gemini suit, had received a contract for backup
development of an Apollo Block II suit. After six months, Houston would
compare David Clark's suit with what Hamilton Standard, aided by B. F.
Goodrich Company, was turning out. International Latex, informed that it
was not being considered in the competition, nevertheless asked
permission to submit an entry. When Crew Systems Division tested the
three suits in June, International Latex had by far the best product.<a

In mid-September, Gilruth and Low told Mueller and Phillips that
Hamilton Standard would continue to manufacture the backpack. To
eliminate the integration problems of the past, Houston would manage the
total system and International Latex would develop the suit under a
separate contract. This arrangement was agreeable to NASA
Headquarters.<a href = "#source35"><b>35</b></a><p>

The other major activity in human factors was the expansion of the
astronaut corps. During 1962 and 1963, NASA had selected the second and
third groups of pilots. These 23, the Gemini generation, with the
original seven formed the basic pool for Apollo crews. In 1965, a new
breed, called &quot;scientist-astronauts,&quot; joined the ranks in
training at Houston. NASA Headquarters hoped to mollify some of the
scientific grumblers and to strengthen its ties with the scientific
community by emphasizing Apollo's potential contribution to science -
not only from the instruments that would send back information from the
moon but from the men who would fly them there. Surprisingly, some of
the drive to enlist these scientist-crewmen came from
engineering-oriented Houston.<p>

Robert B. Voas, human factors assistant to Gilruth and a key figure in
setting up procedures for selecting Mercury pilots, had conferred with
NASA Director of Space Sciences Homer Newell in Washington in 1963 about
Houston's views on scientists for the space program. Voas later met with
Eugene M. Shoemaker (of Newell's office), Joseph Shea, and George Low to
discuss the most appropriate specialties. With an eye to lunar-surface,
long-duration, and earth-orbital activities, the quartet agreed that the
disciplines needed were geology, geophysics, medicine, and
physiology.<p>

At this September 1963 meeting, Voas emphasized that Houston wanted
qualified pilots, but Shea saw no need for any previous flying
experience. Why not take this opportunity to introduce methods for
selecting and training nonpilots? In the end, the consensus was that
candidates with flying backgrounds would be given preference but that
applications from otherwise qualified men who lacked this training would
be accepted. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) should be asked to
help recruit and select scientists for the program. Administrator Webb
approved the recommendation.<a href = "#source36"><b>36</b></a><p>

Harry H. Hess of NAS agreed in April 1964 to have his Space Science
Board define appropriate scientific qualifications (age and physical
criteria would be Houston's responsibility). Hess established an ad hoc
committee, which submitted its report to Newell in July. In October,
NASA announced that it was looking for astronauts with scientific
training. For the first time, the selection criteria did not include a
requirement for test pilot proficiency. Selectees who were not qualified
pilots would be taught to fly after they joined the program. More than
1,000 applications had been received by December; 400 of these were
forwarded to Hess's board in February 1965 for academic ranking.<a href

In June, NASA announced that 6 scientist-astronauts had been chosen from
16 nominated by the science board. In the group were one geologist
(Harrison H. Schmitt), two physicians (Duane E. Graveline and Joseph P.
Kerwin), and three physicists (Owen K. Garriott, Edward G. Gibson, and
F. Curtis Michel). Two of the men, Kerwin and Michel, were qualified jet
pilots, but the others were not. These four reported to Williams Air
Force Base, Arizona, on 29 July for a year of flight training before
joining their colleagues in Houston.<a href =
"#source38"><b>38</b></a><p>

Gilruth wanted another team of pilot-astronauts, and he sent Slayton to
Washington to argue the case before Mueller on 15 January 1965. Mueller
was cool to the idea, but he later told Gilruth that he might bring
another group on board in the fall. On 10 September, NASA announced it
would recruit a fifth set of astronauts to ensure &quot;an adequate
number of flight crews for Project Apollo and future manned
missions.&quot;<a href = "#source39"><b>39</b></a><p>
