<h2>Qualifying Missions</h2>

<p>

Before starting Apollo-Saturn IB launches, however, the operations
people had to clean up one outstanding matter in New Mexico. NASA had
hoped to finish the Little Joe II abort qualification program by the end
of 1965, but on 17 December the Flight Readiness Board refused to accept
the booster and canceled a launch set for the next day. A month later,
at 8:15 on the morning of 20 January 1966, the last Little Joe II headed
toward an altitude of 24 kilometers and a downrange distance of 14
kilometers. Then, as designed, the launch vehicle started to tumble; the
launch escape system sensed trouble and fired its abort rocket, carrying
the command module away from impending disaster. All went well on
Mission A-004 - the launch, the test conditions, the telemetry, the
spacecraft (Block I production model 002), and the postflight analysis.
The spacecraft windows picked up too much soot from the tower jettison
motor, but the structure remained intact. Little Joe II was
honorably-retired, its basic purpose - making sure the launch escape and
earth landing systems could protect the astronauts in either emergency
or normal operations - accomplished.<a href = "#source3"><b>3</b></a><p>

After the last Little Joe flight, the scene shifted to Florida, where a
Saturn IB, the first of the uprated vehicles<a href =
"#explanation1"><b>**</b></a> slated to boost manned flights into earth
orbit, was ready. AS-201 did not get a lot of publicity, but Dale Myers
and his North American crew considered its spacecraft CSM-009 their
&quot;teething&quot; operation:

<blockquote><p>It . . . proved out our procedures, our checkout techniques,
and proved that this equipment [fitted] together. . . . And we got lined
up so we [were] able to handle operations both at the Cape and [in
Downey]. Although spacecraft 009 had some problems in flight . . . we
got what we were looking for from the primary objective, . . . real good
data on our heatshield, which we just can't get any testing on in any
other way.<a href = "#source4"><b>4</b></a></blockquote><p>

The Saturn IB first stage, assembled by Chrysler and with its eight H-1
engines built by Rocketdyne, had been erected on Complex 34 at Cape
Kennedy in August 1965. Command and service module 009 was hoisted atop
the booster on 26 December. Between those dates, the new S-IVB stage
built by Douglas, with its single Rocketdyne J-2 engine, had been mated
to the first stage, checked out, and fitted with an 1,800-kilogram
&quot;instrument unit,&quot; or guidance ring, made by IBM Federal
Systems Division. The top third of the stack - the spacecraft-launch
vehicle adapter, the cylindrical service module, the conical command
module, and the pylon-shaped launch escape tower - had been North
American's responsibility. Once they were stacked together, NASA assumed
control. It took two pages to list AS-201's test objectives, but NASA's
main aims were to check the compatibility and structural integrity of
the spacecraft and launch vehicle and to evaluate the spacecraft's
heatshield performance as the vehicle plunged through the atmosphere.<a
href = "#source5"><b>5</b></a><p>

Spacecraft 009 assembly began in October 1963 and continued throughout
1964, with the inner-shell aluminum-honeycomb pressure vessel taking
shape concurrently with the stainless-steel-honeycomb outer shell and
its ablative heatshield. By April 1965, 009 had reached the test
division at Downey, where it spent the summer. After a review at the
factory on 20 October, NASA's Apollo engineers approved the spacecraft
for shipment to Cape Kennedy. Three months of servicing and checkout
followed before AS-201 was ready for its voyage.<p>

On 20 February 1966, launch technicians at the Cape began a three-day
countdown, fully expecting some of the spacecraft's systems to delay the
launch. But weather turned out to be the chief problem, causing two
postponements. At 5:15 on the afternoon of the 25th, the countdown
resumed. Three seconds before ignition - at 9:00 the next morning - a
computer signaled that pressure in two helium spheres on the Saturn IB
was below the danger line. The count was recycled to 15 minutes before
launch and stopped. Discussions waxed hot between Huntsville and Cape
engineers. Since no one could be sure how serious the problem really
was, the mission was scrubbed at 10:45. Deciding that the drop in
pressure was probably caused by either an excessive flow of oxygen in
the checkout equipment or leakage in the flight system, Wernher von
Braun's Saturn team recommended advancing the ground pressure regulator
to maintain a higher pressure in the spheres. Kurt Debus' Cape crew
agreed, and the launch was back on the track by 10:57.<a href =

At 11:12 a.m. 26 February, AS-201's first stage ignited and drove the
combined vehicles up to 57 kilometers where, after separation, the S-IVB
took over, propelling the payload up to 425 kilometers. The second stage
then dropped off, and the spacecraft coasted in an arc, reaching a peak
altitude of 488 kilometers. At the zenith, the service module engine
fired for 184 seconds, hurtling the command module into a steep descent.
After a 10-second cutoff, the rocket engine fired again, for 10 seconds,
to prove it could restart. The two modules then separated. The command
module, traveling at 8,300 meters per second, turned blunt end forward
to meet the friction caused by the growing density of the atmosphere.<a
href = "#source7"><b>7</b></a><p>

Both booster and spacecraft performed adequately. From liftoff in
Florida to touchdown in the South Atlantic, the mission lasted only 37
minutes. The spacecraft was recovered by the U.S.S. <cite>Boxer</cite>
two and a half hours after splashdown. AS-201 proved that the spacecraft
was structurally sound and, most important, that the heatshield could
survive an atmospheric reentry.<p>

There were several malfunctions, mostly minor. Three were serious.
First, after the service propulsion system fired, it operated correctly
for only 80 seconds. Then the pressure fell 30 percent because of helium
ingestion into the oxidizer chamber. Second, a fault in the electrical
power system caused a loss of steering control, resulting in a rolling
reentry. And, third, flight measurements during reentry were distorted
because of a short circuit. Although Mueller agreed that the mission
objectives had been met, these three problems would have to be
corrected.<a href = "#source8"><b>8</b></a><p>

The service module engine received instant attention. North American's
Robert E. Field and Aerojet-General's Dan David (the engine's Apollo
manager) ordered an analysis of what had gone wrong. The engine had
operated well enough to finish the mission, but Field and David had to
be sure that the Block II engine (undergoing ground testing) would not
run into a similar situation during a lunar mission. They learned that a
leak in an oxidizer line had permitted helium to mix with the oxidizer,
causing the drop in  temperature and pressure.<p>

For all of Houston's insistence on redundancy, this was one major system
that had no backup. And it was a vital system. Because of the
lunar-orbit rendezvous decision, it had a variety of jobs: midcourse
corrections on the way to the moon, lunar-orbit insertion, and
transearth injection (placing the spacecraft on the homeward path) on
the return voyage. Weight penalties forbade a second propulsion system;
the service module engine had to carry its own built-in reliability.<a
href = "#source9"><b>9</b></a><p>

To allow time for studying and solving propulsion system problems and to
prevent program delays, NASA managers shuffled the launch sequence.
Since AS-203 was not scheduled to carry a payload, it would be flown
before AS-202. Billed as a launch vehicle development flight, the third
Saturn IB was to place its S-IVB stage in orbit for study of
liquid-hydrogen behavior in a weightless environment.<a href =
"#explanation2"><b>**</b></a> On 5 July 1966, AS-203 was launched from
Kennedy to insert the 26,500-kilogram second stage into orbit. Ground
observers monitored the S-IVB by television during its first four
circuits, watching the 8,600 kilograms of liquid hydrogen remaining in
its tanks. Despite some turbulence, the S-IVB appeared capable of
boosting the astronauts on a flight path to the moon.<a href =
"#source10"><b>10</b></a><p>

Mission AS-202 was twice as complicated as AS-201. It would last 90
minutes, reach an altitude of 100 kilometers, and travel two-thirds of
the way around the world. Launched on 25 August, AS-202 had a host of
objectives, but the focal interest was service module engine firings.
With clockwork precision, the motor fired four times, for a total
operating time of 200 seconds. After a steeper reentry than expected,
the command module was plucked from the Pacific Ocean near Wake Island
by the recovery forces ten hours after liftoff and placed aboard the
U.S.S. <cite>Hornet.</cite> On the carrier, specialists found that the
heatshield and capsule had come through reentry admirably.<a href =

<a name = "explanation1"><b>**</b></a> The Saturn IB first stage
differed from that of the Saturn I in that its eight engines had been
uprated from 5.8 million to a total of 7.1 million newtons (from 1.3
million to 1.6 million pounds of thrust).<p>

<a name = "explanation2"><b>**</b></a> Langley Research Center made
another study of liquid-hydrogen behavior under zero gravity during
1966. On 7 June, Wallops Island crews launched a two-stage Wasp
(Weightless Analysis Sounding Probe), carrying a 680-kilogram scale
model of an S-II fuel tank. For seven minutes of weightless flight,
television cameras mounted on a transparent tank transmitted data back
to Wallops that added to the confidence of Houston engineers in
launching AS-203 the following month.
