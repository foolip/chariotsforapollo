Invitations had been issued to watch departures before, but not for a
trip like this one. For the first time, man would ride atop a Saturn V
launch vehicle. And before he returned to the earth, he would travel in
a region where the gravitational pull of another celestial body was
stronger than that of his home planet - a first in history that would
endure no matter where mankind might go in the future.<p>

As soon as Borman's crew learned, on 10 August, that it might fly a
lunar mission, the men began to train for the moon flight. On 9
September, sessions on the Cape simulator began. Six weeks before
launch, these turned into day-after-day, ten-hour work periods. With the
help of the support team - Mattingly, Carr, and Brand, who followed the
hardware, coordinated the preparation of checklists, and worked out
spacecraft stowage - the crew was ready on time. Shortly after 2:30 on
the morning of 21 December, Borman, Lovell, and Anders rose and dressed
for the launch day breakfast with, among others, George Low, the man who
had hatched this scheme to send them into lunar orbit on Apollo's second
manned flight.<a href = "#source50"><b>50</b></a><p>

Many guests were in Florida for the send-off, thousands more than the
crew had formally invited. In the chilly predawn, the visitors clogged
the roads, their headlights flashing, searching for the best vantage
points. Busloads of newsmen trundled through the gates, heading for the
press area, and helicopter-borne groups of VIPs landed near the special
viewing stand. All attention focused on Apollo 8, bathed in the glare of
spotlights that made it visible for many kilometers. Radio announcers,
television commentators, and public address spokesmen told millions
around the world and the thousands in the Cape area that soon three
astronauts would leave this globe to visit another. At 7:51, Borman,
Lovell, and Anders, lying in their couches 100 meters above the launch
pad, started on that journey.<a href = "#source51"><b>51</b></a>

Riding the huge Saturn V, propelled by more power than man had ever felt
pushing him before (33.4 million newtons, or 7.5 million pounds of
thrust), the crew had varied impressions. Borman thought it was a lot
like riding the Gemini Titan II. Lovell agreed but added that it seemed
to slow down after it left the pad. Rookie astronaut Anders likened it
to &quot;an old freight train going down a bad track.&quot; The S-IC
stage shook the crew up, but not intolerably. Despite all the power, the
acceleration reached only four g. At engine cutoff, it dropped to one g.
During S-II stage acceleration, pogo stayed within allowable limits and
caused no pain to the pilots. They were glad, however, when the engines
cut off and the second stage fell away. A dozen minutes after launch,
the S-IVB third stage had already fired to drive itself and the
spacecraft into earth-orbital flight. Borman, Lovell, Anders, and the
flight controllers checked the spacecraft and third stage systems for a
revolution and a half, in preparation for the next step in the mission.
At 10:17, former crew member Collins - back from his bout with the bone
spur and now at the capcom's console rather than in the center couch of
<cite>Apollo 8</cite> - opened a new era in space flight when he said,
&quot;All right, you are go for TLI [translunar injection].&quot; Many
watchers in Hawaii, who had seen a launch on live television for the
first time, raced outside and looked for the fireworks high above
them.<a href = "#source52"><b>52</b></a><p>

For five minutes, the S-IVB fired, increasing its speed from 7,600 to
10,800 meters per second. Borman, Lovell, and Anders now traveled at a
greater speed than any human being ever had, shooting outward fast
enough to escape the earth's gravitational influence. Asked later about
impressions at translunar injection, Borman replied:<p>

<blockquote>Psychologically it was a far easier flight than Gemini 7.
You adopt a philosophical approach after you burn TLI, and I wasn't
really concerned about anything. When you are in earth orbit you are
always aware that if something happens you have to react quickly to get
down. Once you burn TLI, . . . you really are not concerned with
reacting swiftly because it is going to take you [at least] two or three
days to get home anyway.</blockquote><p>

The command and service modules separated from the S-IVB and flipped
around so the crew could photograph the adapter, where the lunar module
would be housed on future voyages. Borman commented that formation
flying was no more difficult with the S-IVB than it had been with the
Gemini Agena and that docking with the LM should pose no problems. Since
they had no lander on this mission, they chose not to get too close to
the S-IVB. The crew used the small reaction control engines on the
service module to begin a separation maneuver with a velocity change of
less than a meter per second. But Borman soon noted that the S-IVB was
getting closer, instead of moving away. Both the crew and the flight
controllers were puzzled. Communications crackled back and forth. Kraft
and Bill Tindall talked with Carl R. Huss, who was manning the mission
planning and analysis desk in the flight support area, demanding to know
what to do. Huss held them off until his group had time to figure out
that the crew had not made its maneuver exactly as it should. Studying
the relative positions of the two vehicles, Huss soon gave the
controllers new information to radio to the space ship. The crew fired
the small engines again - this time for a change of two meters per
second, changing the trajectory and moving away from the too - friendly
third stage.<a href = "#source53"><b>53</b></a><p>

Early in the flight, the crew was captivated by the view of the earth
from space, especially the detail revealed at a single glance. Borman
commented, &quot;We see the earth now, almost as a disk.&quot; Then he
asked Collins to &quot;tell Conrad he lost his record.&quot; Conrad and
Gordon had been the highflight champions of Gemini. Lovell, looking
through the center window, began to call out place names as if he were
an announcer in a railway terminal: Florida, Cuba, Gibraltar, Africa
(East and West), Central America, and South America. Borman suggested
that Collins warn &quot;the people in Tierra del Fuego to put on their
rain coats; looks like a storm . . . out there.&quot;<a href =
"#source54"><b>54</b></a><p>

A safe distance away from the S-IVB, the three crewmen left their
couches to take off their pressure suits and met with a surprise -
motion sickness. Rapid body movements brought on nausea. Borman suffered
the most. There had been a rash of gastroenteritis cases at the Cape
just before launch. This &quot;24-hour intestinal flu&quot; might have
caused Borman's illness, but there was another possibility. Because it
had taken longer to get away from the S-IVB than had been planned, he
was late getting to his rest period. To make sure he went to sleep
quickly, he had taken a Seconal tablet. During preflight testing of the
medical supplies Borman had a slight reaction to this sleep-inducing
pill, so he blamed the medication for at least part of his distress.
When he awakened, after very fitful rest, Borman retched and vomited
twice and had a loose bowel movement. The waste management system
worked, but just barely. The crew reported their problems to the flight
surgeon and, as Collins said later in <cite>Carrying the Fire,</cite>
&quot;the first humans to leave the cradle had called for their
paediatrician.&quot; Next day, however, Borman happily told flight
control, &quot;Nobody is sick.&quot;<a href =
"#source55"><b>55</b></a><p>

For the first six hours of flight, the round hatch window through which
Lovell watched the earth receding had been clear. Then it had clouded
over until it was almost useless. The clouding was caused, as it had
been during Schirra's flight, by a gas from the silicone oils used in a
sealant compound. The two side windows also fogged over, but to a
smaller degree. Only the rendezvous windows remained clear throughout
the mission. On one occasion crew members complained that pictures of
the sun taken through the side windows would be of little value, and
they could not even see the sun through the rendezvous windows. They
could not see the moon through <cite>any</cite> of the windows.
Navigator Lovell later recalled that<p>

<blockquote>we never really saw the moon. It was a crescent moon, and
most of it was dark. I saw it several times in the optics as I was doing
some sightings. By and large the body that we were rendezvousing with,
that was coming from one direction as we were going to another, we never
saw. And we took it on faith that the moon would be there, which says
quite a bit for Ground Control.<a href = "#source56"><b>56</b></a>
</blockquote><p>

At a distance of 223,000 kilometers from the earth, 31 hours after
leaving home and 40 before reaching the moon, the crew put on its first
television show. Scenes showed the inside of the craft, with Borman as
director and narrator, Lovell as actor (preparing a meal , and all three
crewmen as Cameramen. Anders installed a telephoto lens to get a better
view of the earth, but the lens did not work. When the crew switched
back to the interior lens, the earth looked like a white blob. Lovell
pointed out that the earth was very bright and they were using a
low-level lens. Borman added that the camera was pointing through a hazy
window. He was disappointed that they could not show their viewers the
&quot;beautiful, beautiful view, with [a predominantly] blue background
and just huge covers of white clouds.&quot;<a href =
"#source57"><b>57</b></a><p>

A hundred thousand kilometers farther out and a day later, the crew
again unstowed the television camera. This time the telephoto lens
worked better. Lovell described what the audience was seeing: the
Western Hemisphere was clearly in view and again he called out names -
the North Pole, South America all the way down to Cape Horn, Baja
California, and the southwestern part of the United States. Once, in a
thoughtful vein, he turned to his commander:<p>

<blockquote>Frank, what I keep imagining is if I am some lonely traveler
from another planet what I would think about the earth at this altitude,
whether I think it would be inhabited or not. . . . I was just curious
if I would land on the blue or brown part of the earth.</blockquote><p>

Anders interjected, &quot;You better hope that we land on the blue
part.&quot;<a href = "#source58"><b>58</b></a><p>

Following the second video presentation, the crew neared a new stage in
manned space flight - travel to a place where the pull of earth's
gravity was less than that of another body. At 3:29 in the afternoon on
Monday, 23 December, that historic crossing was made. At that point, the
spacecraft was 326,400 kilometers from the earth and 62,600 from the
moon, and its velocity had slowed to 1,218 meters per second. Gradually,
as the ship moved farther into the moon's gravitational field, it picked
up speed.<a href = "#source59"><b>59</b></a><p>

Now the crew prepared for another event - again denoted by one of the
abbreviations with which space flight jargon abounds, LOI (lunar-orbit
insertion). Since the craft was on a free-return trajectory - a path
shaped like a figure eight that would loop the ship around the back of
the moon and return it to the earth - Borman wanted &quot;a perfect
spacecraft before we can consider the LOI burn.&quot; He would hate to
leave that good trajectory and then find out that something was wrong.
So far, the big service module engine had worked perfectly every time,
but the path to the moon had been so precise that only two of four
planned midcourse firings had been necessary. Ground control assured him
that everything was in order. At 68 hours 4 minutes into the mission
Carr, at the console, told the crew, &quot;You are go for LOI.&quot; He
also informed the astronauts that the closest point of their approach
should be 119 kilometers above the moon. Minutes before this
transmission, when Borman commented that they still had not seen the
moon, Carr asked what they could see. Anders replied, &quot;Nothing.
It's like being on the inside of a submarine.&quot;<a href =
"#source60"><b>60</b></a><p>

During Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo orbital missions, there had been
periods of communications silence, especially in the southern
hemisphere, because the worldwide tracking network did not cover all
areas. Up till now Borman and his crew had been in continuous contact
during the translunar voyage, but no communications would be possible
when the spacecraft went behind the moon. Just before loss of signal in
the early hours of 24 December (at 4:49), Carr wished them a safe
journey, and Lovell answered, &quot;We'll see you on the other
side.&quot; Eleven minutes later, traveling at 2,600 meters per second
with their heads down so they could watch the lunar landscape, they
fired the service module engine for four minutes to reduce their speed
by 915 meters per second and get into an orbit approximately 111 by 312
kilometers. Although the engine performed flawlessly, Lovell called it
the &quot;longest four minutes I ever spent.&quot; While the engine was
firing, Lovell and Anders exclaimed about their fantastic view of the
moon. Anders added that he had trouble telling the holes from the bumps.
Borman called them back to watch their dials.<a href =
"#source61"><b>61</b></a>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

Borman, Lovell, and Anders knew that the engine had fired successfully,
but nearly a billion persons in 64 countries (according to <cite>TV
Guide</cite>) did not. If the spacecraft had not gone into orbit, it
would come back into communications range 10 minutes earlier than
planned. After what seemed an interminable wait, Paul Haney, on the
public information console in flight control, gleefully announced,
&quot;We got it! We've got it! Apollo 8 now in lunar orbit.&quot;<a href
= "#source62"><b>62</b></a><p>

After 15 minutes of describing the first engine firing and getting
numbers for the second firing (to circularize the orbit at 112
kilometers above the lunar surface), the crew members told their fellow
men what the moon looked like at this close range. Lovell said:<p>

<blockquote>Okay, Houston, The moon is essentially gray, no color; looks
like plaster of Paris or sort of a grayish deep sand. We can see quite a
bit of detail. The Sea of Fertility doesn't stand out as well here as it
does back on earth. There's not as much contrast between that and the
surrounding craters. The craters are all rounded off. There's quite a
few of them; some of them are newer. Many of them . . . - especially the
round ones - look like hits by meteorites or projectiles of some
sort.</blockquote><p>

(Later, during the technical debriefings, Lovell added that<p>

<blockquote>the Lunar Orbiter photographs which we had on board were
quite adequate. There was no problem at all in determining objects
particularly on the near side of the moon. There are suitable
landing-sites. They are very easily distinguished. We could pick them
up. We could work our way in. . . . The Lunar Orbiter photos again were
helpful . . . to check the craters on the back side.)</blockquote><p>

After looking at the back of the moon on several orbits, Anders was
moved to comment:<p>

<blockquote>It certainly looks like we're picking the more interesting
places on the moon to land in. The backside looks like a sand pile my
kids have been playing in for a long time. It's all beat up, no
definition. Just a lot of bumps and holes.<a href =
"#source63"><b>63</b></a></blockquote><p>

As <cite>Apollo 8</cite> whirled around the moon on its ten two-hour
circuits, the spacecraft location display seemed odd at first to those
watching the map in mission control. In earth orbit, spacecraft had
always gone from left to right on the display panels; on the lunar
charts, however, this vehicle moved from right to left. And while it
traveled the crew continued to talk about the view. Anders expressed the
general opinion that the moon was an &quot;unappetizing looking
place&quot;; nevertheless, it did have a kind of stark beauty.
Astronauts commented on the hues of light and dark caused by earthshine
and sunshine. They gave temporary names to some of the craters: names
like (Harrison) Schmitt, (George) Low, (Robert) Gilruth, (Joseph) Shea,
(Theodore) Freeman, (Gus) Grissom, (Ed) White, (James) Webb, (Thomas)
Paine, (Elliot) See, (Alan) Shepard, (Donald) Slayton, (Samuel)
Phillips, (Christopher) Kraft, (Roger) Chaffee, (Charles) Bassett, and
(Gerald) Carr. Once, when flight controller John W. Aaron was the only
one to notice in the general excitement that the environmental system
needed an adjustment, Crater Aaron was named on the spot.<a href =

<hr>
<p>

NASA had been asked by some to postpone the December lunar-orbiting
mission, lest some accident mar Christmas celebrations on earth. But
now, as <cite>Apollo 8</cite> circled the moon this Christmas Eve, there
was additional rejoicing. Early in December, Borman and a friend had
selected a prayer for the occasion. During the third lunar revolution,
Borman asked, &quot;Is Rod Rose there? I have a message for him,&quot;
and sent the following transmission:<p>

<blockquote>To Rod Rose and the people of St. Christopher's, actually to
people everywhere - <p>

Give us, O God, the vision which can see thy love in the world in spite
of human failure.<p>

Give us the faith to trust thy goodness in spite of our ignorance and
weakness.<p>

Give us the knowledge that we may continue to pray with understanding
hearts.<p>

And show us what each one of us can do to set forward the coming of the
day of universal peace. Amen.</blockquote><p>

The crew members had consulted other friends about a possible theme for
their mission, something to signify one world, something to tell
everyone on earth. One suggestion was that they read the story of the
Creation in the first 10 verses of the Book of Genesis in the Bible.
This they did, during the ninth revolution, closing with &quot;Good
night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you - all of
you on the good earth.&quot;<a href = "#source65"><b>65</b></a><p>

Borman later admitted that he and his crew had not really wanted to
carry a television camera; fortunately the decision had not been left to
them. Television from the moon had a wide audience. During the flight
the crew was told that its shows were being seen all over Europe, even
in Moscow and East Berlin; in Japan; in North, Central, and South
America; and perhaps in Africa. Lovell, using his optical devices to get
a better look, described what was being photographed. Anders raced from
window to window for the best vantage points for photographing the lunar
surface, especially the areas being considered for landing sites. By the
seventh revolution, both of them were so tired that Borman put a stop to
the observations. Soon, he knew, they had to start thinking about
transearth injection (TEI, another of those important abbreviations) -
entrance on the path for homes.<a href = "#source66"><b>66</b></a>

<p>

On the tenth lap of the moon, on Christmas morning, 3 days, 17 hours,
and 17 seconds after earth launch, the service module engine fired to
increase their speed by 1,070 meters per second. Rounding the corner
from the back of the moon, Lovell told Mattingly, who had taken over as
CapCom for that shift, &quot;Please be informed there is a Santa
Claus.&quot; In mission control, the holiday became a truly festive
occasion. A Christmas tree was placed below the flight status board,
which again showed an earth map with red and green lights, the
traditional colors of the season. Schmitt, who had coached the crew for
its geological observations, read a parody on Clement C. Moore's poem,
&quot;T'was the Night before Christmas.&quot;<a href =
"#source67"><b>67</b></a><p>

After leaving the moon, the crew was worn out. The astronauts rested,
letting &quot;Isaac Newton&quot; do most of the driving. Following their
naps, CapCom Carr gave them the latest earth news, with emphasis on the
impact their voyage had made on the world.<a href =
"#source68"><b>68</b></a> On the whole, <cite>Apollo 8's</cite>
explorations in December 1968 were acclaimed enthusiastically by the
multitudes who looked at their world for the first time from thousands
of kilometers in space and at their moon from slightly more than a
hundred.<p>

The trip back to the earth was uneventful. During the entire trip,
CSM-103 registered only such expected irregularities as fogging windows,
puddling water, and clattering cabin fans. Now the space-weary travelers
could rest, eat, sleep, show television, and enjoy the ride home. Lovell
continued his navigational sightings, and flight control did the
tracking. Neither could find more than a minor error in the course hours
before the scheduled splashdown in the Pacific; one correction (of less
than two meters per second) was made. Early Saturday morning, 14,500
kilometers above the earth, the crew fired the pyrotechnics to separate
the command module from the service module, which had worked perfectly
whenever it was needed. Fifteen minutes later, the spacecraft crossed
into the fringes of the atmosphere, 120 kilometers above the earth.
Borman told Mattingly they had a real fireball but were in good shape.
Spacecraft speed increased to 9,700 meters per second, subjecting the
crew to a load of nearly seven g.<p>

The craft flew an entry curve to a point over northeast China, slanted
to the southeast, and landed on target in the mid-Pacific. So accurate
was the landing that it worried one of the chief mission planners and
data watchers in Houston. Bill Tindall wrote to Jerome B. Hammack, head
of the Landing and Recovery Division:<p>

<blockquote>Jerry, I've done a lot of joking about the spacecraft
hitting the aircraft carrier, but the more I think about it the less I
feel it is a joke. There are reports that the C Prime command module
came down right over the aircraft carrier [stationed at 165 degrees
02.1' west longitude and 8 degrees 09.3' north latitude] and drifted on
its chutes to land [at 165degrees 1.02' west and 8 degrees 07.5' north,
only 4,572 meters] away. This really strikes me as being too close. . .
. The consequence of the spacecraft hitting the carrier is truly
catastrophic. . . . I seriously recommend relocating the recovery force
at least [8 to 16 kilometers] from the target point.</blockquote><p>

The craft came down in darkness on Friday, 27 December (6 days, 3 hours,
and 42 seconds after launch), flipping over on its nose as it landed.
Until Borman punched the button that inflated the air bags to upright
the spacecraft, its flashing light beacon was lost to the sight of the
recovery helicopters. Mission ground rules required a daylight recovery,
so Borman and his crew waited 45 minutes for the swimmers to open the
hatches. A few minutes later, the helicopter deposited the crew on the
deck of the U.S.S. <cite>Yorktown</cite> for the last lap of - in
Borman's words - &quot;a most fantastic voyage.&quot;<a href =

<p>

Nineteen hundred and sixty-eight was a banner year for the United States
space program, and the celebrations for the latest space explorers were
enthusiastic. In Washington on 9 January 1969, Borman, Lovell, and
Anders visited the White House, where President Johnson presented them
with NASA's Distinguished Service Medal. Then their motorcade passed
through cheering crowds on its way to Capitol Hill, where a joint
session of Congress and the Supreme Court heard Borman's report. The
theme of his talk was that <cite>Apollo 8</cite> &quot;was a triumph of
all mankind.&quot; The three astronauts went to the Department of State
auditorium for a press conference, to describe their trip and answer
questions from the news media. New York City welcomed them with a
ticker-tape parade on the 10th of January, Newark hailed them on the
11th, and Miami greeted them on the 12th during the Super Bowl football
game. They returned to Houston on the 13th for a hometown parade.
Incoming President Richard M. Nixon sent Borman and his family on an
eight-nation goodwill tour of western Europe; they visited London,
Paris, Brussels, The Hague, Bonn, Berlin, Rome, Madrid, and Lisbon.
Everywhere they went, the moon travelers depicted the earth as a
spaceship and stressed international cooperation in space.<a href =
"#source70"><b>70</b></a><p>

Now, 1969 - the year President Kennedy had set for meeting his challenge
- was here. North American's command and service modules had proved that
they were ready to achieve that goal. It was time for Grumman's lunar
module to be put through some strenuous rehearsals to prepare it for the
last - and perhaps the most difficult - 100 kilometers of the
380,000-kilometer voyage.
