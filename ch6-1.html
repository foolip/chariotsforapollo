<h1>Lunar Module</h1>

<p>
<h2>1963&ndash;1964</h2>

<p>

With the signing of the lunar module contract, the Manned Spacecraft
Center and Grumman began the design and development of a vehicle that
would land two men on the moon and, subsequently, take them off. When
NASA selected Grumman in late 1962 to build this final piece in Apollo's
stack, the landing craft was still a long way from a &quot;frozen&quot;
hardware design. While the command and service modules were evolving
from Block I to a more advanced Block II version during 1963 and 1964,
the lunar module was also changing, moving toward the huge,
spidery-legged bug that later landed on the moon.
