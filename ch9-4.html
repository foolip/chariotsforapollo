<h2>The Slow Recovery</h2>

<p>

Within days after the Thompson Board's report, more than a thousand of
those at the Manned Spacecraft Center who were working directly in
support of the formal investigation began making suggestions for meeting
the board's recommendations. Materials selection, substitution, and
stowage inside the command module were thoroughly restudied; and all
cloth parts made of nylon were replaced by Beta fiber, teflon, or fiber
glass. These substitutes were chosen after more than 3,000 laboratory
tests had been run on more than 500 different kinds of materials.<a href

Of immediate importance was the new unified hatch - unified meaning that
the complicated two-hatch system was redesigned into a single hatch. The
new component was heavier than the old, but it would open outward in
five seconds, had a manual release for either internal or external
operation, and would force the boost cover cap out of the way on
opening. It could also be opened independently of internal overpressure
and would be protected against accidental opening by a mechanism and
seal similar to those used on Gemini.<p>

The management of all industrial safety offices within NASA was
revamped, with responsibilities flowing directly to the top at each
location. At the launch center, fire and safety precautions were
upgraded and personnel emergency preparations were emphasized as never
before. Also, at the launch complex itself, a sliding wire was added to
the service structure to permit a rapid descent to the ground.
Reliability and test procedures were more firmly controlled, making it
difficult to inject any last minute or unnecessary changes.<p>

At the Manned Spacecraft Center, full-scale flammability testing
continued, first to try to duplicate the conditions present on 27
January and then to find ways to improve the cabin atmosphere and the
environmental control system. The tests led to replacing all aluminum
oxygen lines that had solder joints with stainless steel tubing that
used brazed joints. Aluminum tubing solder joints that could not be
eliminated from the coolant system were armored with sleeves and seals
wherever exposed. NASA decided to keep the water-glycol coolant fluid
(covering it with flame resistant outer insulation) and added emergency
oxygen masks for protection from smoke and fumes.<a href =
"#source33"><b>33</b></a><p>

At NASA Headquarters, Webb directed Mueller to revamp and reorganize the
major supporting and integrating contractors to put more pressure on
North American, as well as on those manufacturing the other Apollo
vehicles. Boeing was given a technical integration and evaluation
contract, to act as a watch dog for NASA; and General Electric was told
to assume a much greater role in systems analysis and ground support.<a
href = "#source34"><b>34</b></a><p>

The contract situation with North American had reached a peculiar stage
even before the fire. The cost-plus-incentive-fee contract NASA had
negotiated with North American in October 1965 had expired on 3 December
1966. In late January 1967, the legal status of relations was in some
doubt. The objectives of the incentive contract had been to reverse the
trend of continuing schedule slips, to get Block I vehicles delivered
from the factory, to speed up Block II manufacturing, and to bring costs
under control. Progress had been made on all fronts by the end of 1966;
the flights of Block I spacecraft 002, 009, and 011 had been 80 percent
successful, Block II work had moved along, and the cost spiral had
stopped.<p>

Despite the fire, John J. McClintock, chief of the Apollo office program
control division, advocated in April 1967 that NASA negotiate a
follow-on incentive contract, placing heaviest emphasis on flight
performance and quality and less on schedules. North American's business
negotiators had already conceded that no incentive fee could be expected
for spacecraft 012. The closeout cost for the Block I series was set at
$37.4 million. This meant that the learning phase of Apollo had cost
$616 million. Furthermore, North American agreed that there would be no
charge for changes resulting from the AS-204 accident - such as the wire
harnesses, environmental control system improvements, and the unified
hatch. Changes that would enhance mission success or operational
flexibility - changes in the reaction control system, revised inspection
criteria, or features to increase mission longevity - would cost
money.<a href = "#source35"><b>35</b></a><p>

After the uncertain days of February, NASA officials began to sense that
a recovery from the tragedy was under way. Drawing together, workers at
all NASA centers, representing a vast amount of technical strength,
recovered their morale through hard work more rapidly than might have
been expected. Much of Apollo's chance for recovery rested on the fact
that the Block II advanced version of the command module was well along
in manufacturing and that most of its features were direct improvements
over the faults of the earth-orbital Block I. Moreover, the Saturn V,
after experiencing difficulties in the development of its stages, seemed
on the track now.<p>

By early May, Webb and his top staff were looking for ways to show
Congress that Apollo was on the road to recovery. Mueller proposed
flying a Saturn V as soon as possible. Phillips stressed the building
and delivery of standard vehicles. Any modifications of support missions
other than the lunar landing (such as Apollo Applications) should, he
and Mueller agreed, be entirely separate from the mainstream of Apollo.
Moreover, the science program in Apollo should be carried strictly as
supercargo.<a href = "#source36"><b>36</b></a><p>

At the time of the accident, the flight schedule had listed a possible
lunar landing before the end of 1968. After the impounding of material
evidence and the halting of oxygen chamber testing until the
investigation was over, that Apollo schedule was obviously no longer
valid. Several weeks after the fire Seamans told Mueller to scrap all
official flight schedules for manned Apollo missions, using only an
internal working schedule to prevent avoidable slips and cost overruns.
By March, Mueller had told Seamans that NASA could commit a Saturn V to
a mission. In June Low said he believed that the spacecraft had turned
the corner toward recovery, since the changes related to the fire had
been identified and were being made. Even if everything went perfectly,
however, more than 14 months would be needed for complete recovery.<a
href = "#explanation1"><b>*</b></a> <a href =
"#source37"><b>37</b></a><p>

To make certain of stronger program control in the future, Low decided
that all proposals for changes would have to pass an exceedingly tough
configuration control board before being adopted. He asked George W. S.
Abbey, his technical assistant, to draft a strongly worded charter for
the control board. Low next announced that he, Faget, Chris Kraft,
Slayton, Kenneth Kleinknecht, William Lee, Thomas Markley, and Abbey (as
secretary) would meet for several hours every Friday. When medical and
scientific affairs were on the agenda, Berry and Wilmot N. Hess would
join the group. Low himself would make all final decisions, and his new
board members had the authority to ensure that his decisions were
carried out.<a href = "#source38"><b>38</b></a><p>

If Apollo had seemed complicated before the fire, it appeared even more
so afterward. If it gave an impression of being hurried in late 1966, it
gathered still more momentum in late 1967. If an extreme level of
attention had been given to aspects of crew safety and mission success
before the deaths of Grissom and his crew, it rose yet higher after they
were gone. But among the Apollo managers there were still nagging fears
that something might slip past them, something might be impossible to
solve. By mid-1967, however, they were so deep in their work that they
could not avoid a growing confidence.<p>

Atwood said the biggest mistake had been locking the crew inside the
spacecraft and pumping in oxygen at a higher than sea-level pressure.
There was no way to eliminate fire hazards under such conditions. So
NASA and North American substituted a nitrogen-and-oxygen atmosphere at
ground level, replacing the nitrogen gradually with pure oxygen after
launch. Bergen, who had taken over the leadership of North American's
Downey division from Storms, moved into the factory while recovery work
was going on. He made a practice of appearing on the plant floor,
walking around asking questions, during each of the three shifts. Some
of the workers wondered if he ever slept. During visits to Downey, Low
was often to be seen watching plant activities on Saturdays. Many
doubted, Bergen later said, that the recovery could be made in a
reasonable time because &quot;everything had come to a screeching
halt.&quot; Bergen credited Gilruth's assignment of Borman and his group
and Healey's performance as manager of spacecraft 101 as the keys to
getting the command module back into line.<a href =
"#source39"><b>39</b></a><p>

NASA's leaders, after reviewing the progress, decided that it was time
for a flight demonstration to prove that the bits and pieces of Apollo
had been picked up and were being put back together. Apollo-Saturn
Mission 501, with command module 017, was set for early autumn of 1967.
If the first flight of the Apollo-Saturn V combination was successful,
the rest would follow in due course.<a href =
"#source40"><b>40</b></a><p>

As early as 9 May 1967, Houston proposed four manned missions - one with
only the command and service modules, the other three with all the
vehicles - before any attempt at a lunar landing. Headquarters in
Washington believed that the lunar-landing mission might be possible on
the fourth manned flight, which Houston thought was unrealistic -
&quot;all-up&quot; should not mean &quot;all-out.&quot; Kraft warned Low
that a lunar landing should not be attempted &quot;on the first flight
which leaves the earth's gravitational field&quot;:

<blockquote><p>There is much to be gained from the operations which could
be conducted on the way to and in the vicinity of the moon. The many
questions of thermal control away from the earth's environment,
navigation and control during translunar flight, communications and
tracking at lunar distances, lighting conditions and other flight
experiences affecting astronaut activities in the vicinity of the moon,
lunar orbit and rendezvous techniques, the capability of the MSFN to
provide back-up information and many other operating problems will be
revealed when we fly in this new environment. It would be highly
desirable to have had this experience when we are ready to commit to a
lunar landing operation, thereby allowing a more reasonable
concentration on the then new problems associated with the descent to
the lunar surface.<a href = "#source41"><b>41</b></a></blockquote><p>

Deputy Administrator Seamans and his aides made a swing around the
manned space flight circuit in June, visiting Kennedy, Huntsville,
Mississippi Test, Michoud, and Houston. In the course of the tour,
Seamans observed a definite upsurge of confidence within the Apollo
team, although there were still worries. For example, at Kennedy, with
planning predicated on a six-week checkout of the Apollo-Saturn in the
Cape facilities and launch during the seventh week, there was some
feeling that the schedule for the launch of Apollo 4<a href =
"#explanation2"><b>**</b></a> was extremely tight. Huntsville was still
worried about the S-II stage of the launch vehicle, which had gone
through a rather tough year of testing in 1966. And Houston, as a result
of fire-related changes, was fighting the age-old problem of fattening
spacecraft. On top of this, the lunar module was still having ascent
engine instability problems, also left over from the preceding year.<a
href = "#source42"><b>42</b></a><p>

The next month, in July, Mueller and an entourage visited the North
American plant at Downey<a href = "#explanation3"><b>***</b></a> to see
what the contractor had done about the Thompson Board's recommendations.
As they walked around the manufacturing area, Mueller seemed generally
pleased with progress.<a href = "#source43"><b>43</b></a> Within a very
few months, that progress was to be demonstrated in a very satisfactory
manner.

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name = "explanation1"><b>*</b></a> During fiscal 1970 budget hearings
before the House space committee, Congressman James Fulton asked George
Mueller on 11 March 1969 to give a &quot;statement in the record of the
actual cost in dollars . . . and actual delay caused . . . by the Apollo
204 fire. . . .&quot; Mueller's submitted reply said, &quot;The
estimated additional direct cost to Apollo . . . resulting from the
Apollo 204 accident is $410 million, principally in the area of
modifications to the spacecraft. The accident delayed the first manned
flight test of the Apollo spacecraft by approximately 18
months.&quot;<p>

<a name = "explanation2"><b>**</b></a> Grissom's crew had received
approval for an &quot;Apollo 1&quot; patch in June 1966, but as the time
for the launch approached NASA Headquarters was leaning toward calling
that mission &quot;AS-204.&quot; After the accident, the widows asked
that Apollo 1 be reserved for the flight their husbands would never
make. Webb, Seamans, and Mueller agreed. For a time, mission planners in
Houston called the next scheduled launch &quot;Apollo 2.&quot; In March
1967, Low wrote to Mueller, suggesting that, for historic purposes, the
flights should be called &quot;Apollo 1&quot; (AS-204), &quot;Apollo
1A&quot; (AS-201), &quot;Apollo 2&quot; (AS-202), and &quot;Apollo
3&quot; (AS-203). In April, Julian Scheer, Assistant Administrator for
Public Affairs, notified the centers that the NASA Project Designation
Committee had approved the Office of Manned Space Flight recommendation
of &quot;Apollo 4&quot; for the first Apollo-Saturn V mission (AS-501),
but there would be no retroactive renaming of AS-201, -202, or -203.
Much correspondence followed, but the sequence of, and reasoning behind,
mission designations has never been really clear to anyone.<p>

and Information Systems Division in Downey had been renamed simply the
&quot;Space&quot; Division, to reflect its major mission.
