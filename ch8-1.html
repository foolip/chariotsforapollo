<h2>1966</h2>

<p>

By 1966 Apollo had lost much of the emotional support of Congress and
the public that had welled up five years earlier in the wake of the
Soviet Vostoks. The drop was reasonable, since the successes of the
Gemini and Saturn I programs had led many Americans to believe the space
race with Russia had been won. Moreover, domestic and foreign
commitments, made primarily in 1965, to President Johnson's &quot;Great
Society&quot; and to Southeast Asia had placed more demands on tax
dollars than had been foreseen. For fiscal 1967, NASA submitted a budget
request of $5.58 billion, the President cut it to $5.012, and Congress
chopped it to $4.968. Apollo came through virtually unscathed; but its
follow-on, Apollo Applications, felt the weight of the Budget Bureau's
ax.<a href = "#source1"><b>1</b></a>

Obtaining funds for space exploration might be becoming more difficult,
but most NASA officials had no time to worry about future programs.
Apollo boilerplate flight tests had ended, and production spacecraft
would soon fly atop the Saturn IB. Manned Spacecraft Center Director
Robert Gilruth told Chris Kraft, Director for Flight Operations in
Houston, to get his people started on the job ahead.<p>

By January 1966, Kraft's group had drafted a preliminary
&quot;operations plan.&quot; In February it distributed a more complete
version that pinpointed the responsibilities and functions of everyone
connected with flights, beginning with Director Gilruth. The plan listed
19 specific documents, ranging from the &quot;mission directive&quot;
prepared by Joseph Shea's Apollo office to the &quot;postflight
trajectory analysis&quot; compiled by Kraft's own directorate, that
would be essential in conducting a mission. Kraft also named John Hodge
as flight director for AS-202 and AS-203. Kraft, himself, would direct
AS-204, the first manned mission in the program.<a href =
