<h2>The &quot;Sub-Prime&quot; and the Radar Problem</h2>

<p>

Grumman contracted with Aerospace Communications and Controls Division
of Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in Burlington, Massachusetts, for
engineering support, radars, an inflight test system, and components of
the stabilization and control system. RCA, the &quot;sub-prime&quot;
contractor, was also to design and manufacture ground checkout equipment
for these items. Although the two companies had worked together for
years, the Grumman-RCA experience with the lunar module was fraught with
difficulties. Electronics components became a pacing item in the
development of the lander's subsystems, causing unhappiness at NASA
Headquarters and culminating in an investigation by the General
Accounting Office.<a href = "#source31"><b>31</b></a><p>

The extremely complex stabilization and control system was the source of
much of the trouble. Design had to await definition of mission
requirements and planning. To complicate matters further, Grumman did
not buy the total system but merely procured parts, through RCA, from
Minneapolis-Honeywell, which supplied similar items to North American
for the command module. There was some commonality of parts, but the
lander hardware had to be repackaged, often causing lengthy delays.
Communications gear was purchased from Collins Radio and Motorola in the
same manner. Tiring of this roundabout way of doing business, Houston
finally decided to speed things up by supplying the television camera,
originally intended for development by RCA, as government-furnished
equipment. In mid-1964, the Westinghouse Electric Company was asked to
submit a bid for the camera.<a href = "#source32"><b>32</b></a><p>

RCA's role was further cut when inflight maintenance was canceled. At
the outset of the program, the crews had been expected to perform basic
repairs to electronics equipment in the lander, as well as in the
command module, using spare parts stowed aboard the spacecraft. By
mid-1963, Houston Flight Operations Director Christopher Kraft was
arguing that the crewmen simply would not have time to repair faulty
hardware during lunar module operations. Thomas Kelly was convinced that
inflight maintenance would degrade reliability instead of improving it.
This was probably true, since the electronic spares would be subjected
to cabin humidity even when stowed. When George Mueller took over as
manned space flight chief in Washington, he also had reservations about
the plan. Inflight maintenance was deleted from the program and the crew
was to rely on operational displays and the caution and warning system
to detect malfunctions. Redundancy would be &quot;wired in,&quot; with
duplicate or backup components the crew could switch to, and all
electronics inside the cabin would be hermetically sealed to protect
against moisture and contaminants.<a href = "#source33"><b>33</b></a><p>

Radar, tied into the guidance and navigation system, was one of the
hardest pieces of the lunar module to qualify. Two sets would be used,
one for landing, the other for rendezvous. Under its blanket subcontract
for electronics, RCA was to design the system, manufacture the
rendezvous radar, and buy the landing subsystem. After evaluating
proposals from four bidders, RCA picked Ryan Aeronautical Company,
developer of landing radar for Surveyor.<a href =
"#source34"><b>34</b></a><p>

Development of the lunar module radar was not expected to be difficult,
since no technological breakthrough was demanded for either system.
Integrating these sets with the guidance and navigation system, however,
was another matter. There were also problems in properly placing and
insulating the antennas. Getting the precise ranging accuracy needed and
overcoming the weight increases that resulted from meeting these
requirements probably posed the biggest problem of all. A happy medium
between optimum weight and desired reliability was elusive, and progress
was practically nil.<p>

During the final quarter of 1964, the chief of guidance and control in
Houston warned Shea that the radar program was having trouble with
weight, accuracy, reliability, thermal characteristics, and costs. Shea
and William A. Lee, chief of MSC's Apollo Operations Planning Division,
began to think about omitting the rendezvous radar from both the command
and lunar modules. Lee believed these units were doubly redundant, since
rendezvous could be performed by the command module pilot with the aid
of data relayed by the Manned Space Flight Network. Donald G. Wiseman,
an instrumentation and electronics specialist in Houston, thought
rendezvous could also be conducted by the lunar module crew, using
ground, optical tracking, and S-band and VHF communications equipment
ranging information in place of radar. Although not everyone agreed that
the system should be eliminated, work was started on the development of
an optical tracker.<a href = "#source35"><b>35</b></a>
