<h1>The Course and the Future</h1>

<p>

Two major questions faced NASA planners during 1965. Was Apollo on
course, at what was essentially its midpoint, to meet the goal of a
lunar landing before the end of the decade? And what should follow
Apollo in the manned space flight arena?<p>

To find the answer to the first question, the House Subcommittee on NASA
Oversight, led by Teague, set up a special staff in June to assess
schedules, funding, and spacecraft management. After three months of
probing, a staff study published under the title <cite>Pacing Systems of
the Apollo Program</cite> identified seven bottlenecks in Apollo. For
the lander, pacing systems were the descent engine, rendezvous radar,
weight growth, and ground support equipment; for the command and service
modules, they were engineering drawing releases, subassembly delivery
and certification, and tooling and fabrication of the heatshield. The
subcommittee concluded that NASA was applying its resources effectively
to these problems and the program was progressing on schedule.<a href =

NASA leaders, meanwhile, were worrying about what would come after
Apollo, in view of the rising demand for dollars for human resources on
the domestic front and military commitments abroad, particularly in
Southeast Asia. Out of this concern came a new Headquarters program
office called Apollo Applications (AAP), headed by David M. Jones, an
Air Force major general assigned to NASA. Mueller had two objectives in
setting up this office: preserving the Apollo team and using the
hardware to get some pay-offs in science and earth resources.<p>

To Houston this was evading the issue. In a lengthy letter to Mueller,
MSC Director Gilruth manifested "deep concern that . . . a critical
mismatch exists between the present AAP planning, the significant
opportunities for manned space flight, and the resources available for
this program." Speaking both for himself and his deputy, George Low -
who as much as anyone within NASA had helped chart the course for Apollo
- Gilruth proposed that "the next major step in manned space flight
should involve a large permanent manned orbital station," which would be
"an operational step leading to man's exploration of the planets." As
structured, he said, AAP would simply maintain the status quo in the
production and flight of Saturn-Apollo hardware. "Merely doing this,
without planning for a new program, and without doing significant
research and development as part of AAP, will not maintain the momentum
we have achieved."<a href = "#source56"><b>56</a></b><p>

Thus the total climate of opinion surrounding Apollo had altered. No
longer did the moon seem the all-important - and all-consuming - goal it
had been. Other objectives in the new ocean of space were taking shape.
But conditions were not ripe: 1966 would be a year of progress for
existing manned space flight programs, not a curtain-raiser for any
major new projects. In one more flight, Little Joe II would complete its
series of Apollo tests; after five more missions, which made orbital
flight routine, Gemini would phase out and Lunar Orbiter and Surveyor
would phase in; and Saturn and Apollo vehicles would taste the first
fruits of success.
