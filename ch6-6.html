<h2>Environment and Electricity</h2>

<p>

Grumman selected Hamilton Standard to supply the environmental control
system for the lunar module. Like AiResearch's unit in the command
module, it was a &quot;closed-loop&quot; atmospheric circulation system,
using supercritical oxygen and nonregenerative removal of carbon dioxide
to provide a pure oxygen atmosphere. The system also had a
liquid-circulating network and heat-absorbent panels to maintain a
comfortable temperature inside the cabin. By mid-1964, Hamilton Standard
had finished the design phase and begun fabrication and testing.
Occasional problems arose during development, but none that threatened
the manufacture of a successful subsystem.<a href =

United Aircraft Corporation's Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Division, a
legendary name in aircraft powerplants, was also a pioneer in research
on fuel cells using hydrogen and oxygen as reactants to generate
electricity. Grumman picked this firm in July 1963 to develop the power
system for the lander. The fuel cell program was laden with technical
and managerial problems. Many of the lander's components operated with
considerable independence, but the electrical power system had a complex
interrelation with virtually every subsystem in the vehicle. The
question of how many fuel cell stacks and how many tanks of reactant
were needed to meet electrical requirements was, therefore, difficult to
answer. In March 1964, Houston approved a three-cell, five-tank
arrangement; by summer the fuel cell was in deep technical trouble. NASA
and Grumman engineers concluded that it might take more than a year to
get the cells working with the other systems properly. The lunar module,
which had begun development a year late, did not have the time to
spare.<p>

Houston told Grumman in late 1964 to consider substituting batteries for
fuel cells, and on 26 February 1965 Bethpage was ordered to make the
change. Although the switch was not entirely welcome to the lunar module
design team, it caused no appreciable delay. And to some it came as a
distinct relief; the beauty of batteries lay in their simplicity, hence
their reliability, in contrast to fuel cells. Some of the battery
development cost would be offset by the cancellation of the Pratt &amp;
Whitney contract.<a href = "#source30"><b>30</b></a>
