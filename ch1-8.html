<h2>Portents for Apollo</h2>

<p>

During the latter part of the 1960 presidential campaign, Apollo (and
even Mercury) faced a murky future. This period of doubt, caused by the
imminent change in administrations, led Glennan to call a mid-October
session at Williamsburg, Virginia, to wrestle with the question of
future NASA programs. The attendees - including top management from
Headquarters and all the centers - voiced varying opinions, but the need
for a manned lunar landing program threaded throughout the discussions.
Glennan observed that the decision on Apollo would have to wait until
the new President took office, although he assumed there would be few
changes, since space flight was surely a nonpartisan ambition. But the
next month, November 1960, Glennan was still not sure that Apollo was
ready to move beyond the study phase without more answers than all his
committees and groups had yet produced. Before spending the $15 billion
he estimated Apollo would cost, Glennan wanted the reasons for going to
the moon - international prestige or whatever they might be - laid out
more clearly.<p>

With the coming of the new year, then, there was a measure of
uncertainty. Assuming that manned space flight would have some part in
John F. Kennedy's &quot;New Frontier,&quot; however, Glennan
strengthened the chances for an Apollo program by announcing that the
Space Task Group was a separate autonomous field element, responsible
for all civilian manned space flight programs. Although the location of
its permanent home was still unsettled - and Glennan favored Ames in
California - Gilruth's position was affirmed. On the heels of this move,
Glennan called the Space Exploration Program Council together again, to
talk with many of those who had been at Williamsburg. He still warned
that an Apollo hardware contract lacked presidential endorsement, but he
also conceded that NASA seemed to be inevitably headed toward a lunar
landing mission.<a href = "#source57">57</a><p>

During the first week of January 1961, Glennan waited in vain for some
member of the incoming administration to get in touch with him about the
transition. Meanwhile, Dryden and Seamans discussed the coming
congressional budget hearings for fiscal 1962.<a href =
"#explanation1">*</a> At this time, they decided to formalize Low's
committee as the &quot;Manned Lunar Landing Task Group.&quot; The
expanded team was to prepare a position paper to answer, in some depth,
the questions, &quot;What is NASA's Manned Lunar Landing Program? . . .
How much is it going to cost to land a man on the moon and how long is
it going to take?&quot;<a href = "#source58">58</a><p>

Low and his committee (still primarily a Headquarters group - Hall,
Nicks, Alfred M. Mayo, and Pearson - but now including Faget and Koelle
as spokesmen from the field centers for the spacecraft and launch
vehicle) met on 9 January. Seamans outlined the group's task in detail.
The members were to draft plans for a lunar program, describing both
direct ascent and rendezvous, for use in budget presentations to
Congress. They were to include cost and schedule estimates for both
modes. Developing a plan for manned lunar landings was among NASA's
major objectives, the group was reminded, even though the program was
not yet approved.<a href = "#source59">59</a><p>

During the next four weeks, the committee labored over &quot;A Plan for
Manned Lunar Landing&quot; and submitted it on 7 February. Low told
Seamans that the report &quot;accurately represents, to the best of my
knowledge, the views of the entire Group.&quot; No major technological
breakthroughs, no crash programs, and no real physiological barriers
were envisioned. The concurrent development of spacecraft and launch
vehicle should lead, if financially supported, almost inevitably to a
manned lunar landing in 1968 to 1970, they thought. Its costs ought to
peak around 1966 and total about $7 billion. The big Saturn and bigger
Nova boosters would be built and tested anyway, the group reasoned, and
a manned space station in earth orbit would probably be extant by then.
Low conceived Apollo in two phases: first, extended earth-orbital
missions; second, circumlunar, leading to lunar landing missions.<p>

The Low Committee stated that lunar landings could be made by using
either direct-ascent or earth-orbital rendezvous modes. Launch vehicle
development would determine how large a step NASA could take in space at
any given time. Moon landings demanded launch vehicles that could lift
from 27,200 to 36,300 kilograms into space fast enough to escape the
earth's gravitational pull. (The C-2 Saturn in the agency's fiscal 1962
budget request would be able to boost no more than 7,000-8,000 kilograms
to that velocity. It could thus send manned flights to the vicinity of
the moon, but it could not land there and then return its cargo to the
earth.) The committee cited two ways of getting this booster capability
for manned landings, either refueling a number of C-2s in earth orbit or
building a vehicle large enough to perform the mission directly from the
ground. Although both appeared feasible, the earth-orbital-rendezvous
scheme would probably be quicker. Accordingly, NASA must develop orbital
operations techniques; refueling in orbit would probably be possible by
1967 or 1968.<a href = "#source60">60</a><p>

And there the matter rested. Early 1961 was an unsettled period for
NASA. With the country acquiring a new President and the agency a new
Administrator, the prospect for moon flights was highly uncertain. But
Kennedy was deeply interested in space. Before his inauguration, he had
appointed an ad hoc committee, headed by Jerome B. Wiesner of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to review the entire missile and
space effort. The Wiesner Committee's report, quite critical of the way
Mercury was being managed and of NASA's apparent bias in favor of manned
space flight at the expense of the unmanned science programs, called for
a stronger technical competency within NASA and a redefinition of
goals.<a href = "#source61">61</a> Because Wiesner had joined in the
&quot;missile gap&quot; rhetoric during the November presidential
campaign, his committee's report the following January was suspect in
some quarters. Nevertheless, it spurred NASA's civil service workers to
prove it wrong.<p>

The Wiesner report also touched off a debate on the choice of a new
leader for the space agency. Wiesner, like other scientifically oriented
advisers within the administration, favored a proved and respected
scientist-engineer. Shortly before his inauguration, however, Kennedy
had delegated responsibility for space matters to Vice President-Elect
Lyndon B. Johnson, long-time champion of America's space programs in
Congress and architect of the 1958 legislation that created NASA. In
contrast to Wiesner, Johnson wanted a hard-driving, politically
experienced administrator to preside over the agency. When he was named
to head the powerful National Aeronautics and Space Council, Johnson
won.<p>

Glennan's resignation from NASA was effective 20 January, but Kennedy
did not announce his successor until the end of the month. In the
interim, at the request of the White House staff, Dryden was Acting
Administrator. On 30 January, the President ended a spate of speculation
by naming James E. Webb as NASA's new head. Quickly confirmed by the
Senate, Webb was sworn in on 15 February. Dryden, whose continued
service the new Administrator solicited, remained as Deputy
Administrator, personifying scientific interests within the agency.<p>

Dramatic changes for NASA seemed likely. Webb was a man with a long and
varied background in government, industry, and public service. During
the Truman era he had first been Director of the Bureau of the Budget
(1946&ndash;1949) and later Under Secretary of State (1949&ndash;1952). With
forceful demeanor, grandiloquent style, and a genius for
extemporization, Webb soon became a familiar figure on Capitol Hill as
champion of the space program and defender of the agency - and its
fiscal interests - before Congress.<a href = "#source62">62</a><p>

Webb met with his key officials from Headquarters and the field centers
at NASA's fifth semiannual retreat, in Luray, Virginia, 8&ndash;10 March 1961.
He announced that Seamans would be the &quot;operating vice
president&quot; of the agency and that the field centers would, in
future, report directly to Seamans rather than to the major Headquarters
staff offices, as in the past. There were hints of other significant
changes that would be needed to manage a program the size of Apollo,
once it was approved. Webb's ideas were not hatched overnight but were
founded, in part at least, on documents passed on to him by Glennan. The
principal contribution was a study led by Lawrence A. Kimpton,
Chancellor of the University of Chicago. Contained in the &quot;Kimpton
Report&quot; were recommendations that the centers should report
directly to the Associate Administrator, that formally established
project offices should manage projects, and that NASA should rely more
on contracting support. In 1961, many of these suggestions were
implemented. Seamans' new assignment was the first step along that
path.<a href = "#source63">63</a><p>

Testimony before congressional committees began at the end of February.
George Low described Apollo both as an earth-orbiting laboratory and as
a program for circumlunar flight that could lead to a manned lunar
landing. Abraham Hyatt outlined NASA's long-term objectives, with charts
that showed large launch vehicle development as the pacing item.<p>

Before Seamans and Low finished this round of testimony, a Russian test
pilot named Yuri A. Gagarin circled the earth on 12 April in
<cite>Vostok I.</cite> Congressional deliberations changed into direct
demands to respond to the Russian challenge, just as they had in October
1957 after <cite>Sputnik I.</cite> Overton Brooks, chairman of the House
Committee on Science and Astronautics, said bluntly on 14 April,
&quot;My objective, and this is speaking individually, is to beat the
Russians.&quot; Seamans reminded the committee that Webb had told them
only the day before that the cost of Apollo, without a crash program,
would be between $20 billion and $40 billion over the next ten years.
With an accelerated program, that figure could go even higher.<a href =
"#source64">64</a><p>

President Kennedy had begun strengthening the space program in late
March. He sent Congress a revised fiscal 1962 budget for NASA, raising
the agency's funding more than $125 million over Eisenhower's
recommended level of $1.11 billion. Much of this increase was earmarked
for the Saturn C-2 and the F-1 engine and was expected to speed up
development of these important items significantly.<a href =
"#explanation2">**</a> <a href = "#source65">65</a><p>

Seamans suggested even greater increases than NASA actually received.
Given the funding levels he proposed, manned circumlunar flight with the
C-2 would be feasible in 1967 rather than 1969. The F-1 engine,
essential to an even larger launch vehicle, was the key to manned
landings. <em>&quot;The first manned lunar landings,&quot;</em> Seamans
stressed, &quot;depend upon this chemical engine as well as on the
orbital and circumlunar programs and <em>can be achieved in 1970 rather
than 1973.&quot;</em> More money, he told Webb, &quot;will increase the
rate of closure on the USSR's lead in weight lifting capability and
significantly advance our manned exploration of space beyond Project
Mercury.&quot; Webb forwarded Seamans' memorandum to President Kennedy
on 23 March 1961, in response to a request for information about NASA's
plans.<a href = "#source66">66</a><p>

While NASA's leaders appeared to have pushed Apollo closer to an
approved program, activities in the field had also accelerated. The
Technical Liaison Groups formed to evaluate the three industrial studies
had grown to include, part-time, virtually every senior engineer in the
Space Task Group, as well as representatives from other NASA centers. By
mid-February, feverish preparations were being made by Donlan's office
for separate midterm reviews of the Martin, General Electric, and
Convair contracts. In March, the industrial teams came to Langley one by
one and stood before a large audience who had come to hear what the
contractors had to tell.<p>

Each company followed roughly the same agenda: trajectory analysis;
guidance and control; configuration and aerodynamics; heating;
structures and materials; human factors; onboard propulsion; mechanical
systems; and instrumentation and communications.<p>

The NASA auditors commented on the presentations, each of which seemed a
bit too general and lacking in the technical information the NASA
planners wanted. Martin Company's team, for instance, led by E. E. Clark
and Carlos de Moraes, was complimented for its briefing on mechanical
systems but chided for neglecting structures and materials analyses
related to Apollo design requirements. The General Electric group,
headed by George R. Arthur and Ladislaus W. Warzecha, scored high on
human factors but low in its discussions of mission abort studies,
instrumentation, and communications.<a href = "#source67">67</a><p>

Faget was especially irritated that none of the contractors had proposed
modifying and expanding the blunt-body, Mercury-style spacecraft. Some
theoreticians had predicted that the hot gas radiation heating caused by
Apollo's greater reentry speeds would make this shape unacceptable, but
experiments by Clarence Syvertson at the Ames Research Center indicated
that these predictions would not materialize. In addition, Caldwell
Johnson, Faget's chief design assistant, had recently finished a study
on the advantages of the conical, blunt-body command module over the
designs of any of the three contractors. Willard M. Taub, of the same
office, later recalled that the contractors, after the midterm review,
&quot;had to jump in real fast and come in with a new vehicle based on
the [Space Task Group] version.&quot; Conversely, Mel Barlow of Convair
looked on the modified Mercury as only a slight technological advance.
He said he was shocked to learn that NASA intended to keep that
configuration.<a href = "#source68">68</a><p>

While most of the Space Task Group labored under heavy operational
pressures - the third Mercury-Atlas had failed almost as miserably as
the first - the nine Technical Liaison Groups at Langley tried to
clarify the engineering designs for a spacecraft that would
circumnavigate, and perhaps land on, the moon. Although they
acknowledged that Saturn C-2 (or its next larger version) should be
capable of sending a large payload to that body, the questions of how
large, by what route, and with what capacities were by no means settled
or even well defined.<a href = "#source69">69</a><p>

In early May of 1961, the first reports from the completed study
contracts began arriving at the Space Task Group. All three contractors
had spent considerably more than the $250,000 NASA paid them for the
work.<p>

<cite>Using a model at upper left, William Rector of General Dynamics
Corp. describes the design his company proposed for the Apollo lunar
mission.</cite>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

Convair/Astronautics' report depicted a three-module lunar-orbiting
spacecraft. Command, mission, and propulsion modules were designed
primarily for lunar orbit, with flexibility and growth potential built
in for more advanced missions (such as a lunar landing) with the same
basic vehicle design. A total Apollo cost of $1.25 billion over about
six years was estimated.<p>

The San Diego-based company had selected a lifting-body concept, much
like one conceived several years earlier by Alfred Eggers of Ames for
the return vehicle. The command module, with an abort tower attached
through launch, would nestle inside a large mission module. What
Astronautics proposed was similar in its mode of operation to the
command and service modules that ultimately evolved for Apollo.
Convair/Astronautics envisioned mission planning as building
progressively upon many earth-orbital flights before attempting
circumlunar and then lunar-orbital missions. Earth landings would be by
glidesail parachute near San Antonio, Texas. Elementary experiments that
would evolve into rendezvous, docking, artificial gravity, maneuverable
landing, and an eventual lunar landing were foreseen. The study cost the
contractor about $1 million, four times what NASA paid the company. The
other two contractors spent even more of their own money.<a href =

<p>

General Electric's study cost twice as much as Convair's and featured a
semiballistic blunt-body reentry vehicle. Had this configuration been
selected, the payload sent to the moon would have resembled the nose
cone flown on the early Saturn C-1. General Electric's design
capitalized upon hardware already almost ready to fly, but it did offer
one innovation - a cocoonlike wrapping for secondary - pressure
protection in case of cabin leaks or meteoroid puncture. Although
General Electric did not estimate the final costs in its summary, the
company was confident of achieving circumlunar flight by the end of 1966
and lunar-orbital flight shortly thereafter.<a href =

as its Apollo study.</cite>

<p>

The Martin Company produced the most elaborate study of the three.
Martin not only followed all the Space Task Group guidelines, but also
went far beyond in systems analysis. Focusing on versatility,
flexibility, safety margins, and growth, this was the only study that
detailed the progression of steps from lunar orbiting to lunar landing.
Martin's spacecraft would have been similar to the Apollo spacecraft
that ultimately emerged. Later, when the hardware contract proposals
were evaluated, Martin scored first on configuration design.<p>

Martin recommended a five-part spacecraft. The command module was a
flat-bottomed cone with a rounded apex and a tower for a tractor-rocket
launch escape system. Behind the flat aft bulkhead were propulsion,
equipment, and mission modules. Tradeoffs between weight and propulsion
requirements led to the selection of a pressurized shell of
semimonocoque aluminum alloy coated with a composite heatshield of
superalloy plus charring ablator. Two crewmen would sit abreast, with
the third behind, in couches that could rotate for reentry g-load
protection and for getting in and out of the spacecraft. Flaps for
limited maneuverability on reentry, a parachute landing system, and a
jettisonable mission module that could also serve as a solar storm
cellar, a laboratory, or even the descent stage for a lunar lander were
also featured. Almost 300 persons in Martin spent the better part of the
six months and about $3 million on the data and designs for their
recommendations.<a href = "#source72">72</a><p>

NASA and its Space Task Group might have evaluated the contractor
reports at a more measured pace in more normal times, but in April - the
month before these reports came in - the pressures &quot;to get America
moving&quot; toward the moon became intense.

1960 placed Apollo costs at $100,000 for FY 1960 and $1,000,000 for

1962.<p>

<a name = "explanation2">**</a> Kennedy and Webb held budgetary
discussions on 22 March, in which they covered 11 actions NASA would
have to take to accelerate the space program: (1) increase the number of
Mercury flights to learn more about man's behavior in space; (2)
initiate possible long-duration Mercury flights with intermediate launch
vehicles; (3) accelerate exploration to provide data for manned flights;
(4) speed up studies of manned reentries at lunar return velocities; (5)
begin development of solid-propellant rockets for first or second stages
of Nova; (6) start design work on clustered F-1 engines for Nova; (7)
commence design engineering of Nova, using clustered F-1 engines for the
first stage; (8) begin developing tankage and engines for Nova's second
stage; (9) expedite supporting technology required for attainment of
lunar goal; (10) start construction of launch pads and other facilities;
and (11) provide additional vehicles and spacecraft to hasten the Tiros
meteorological program. Budget Director David E. Bell later wrote the
President that Webb and his associates had presented the case for an
accelerated space program very well. But, he warned, the United States
might be better advised to concern itself with <cite>&quot;men on
earth&quot;</cite> rather than with putting <cite>&quot;men on the
moon.&quot;</cite>
