<h1>Plans and Progress in Space Flight</h1>

<p>

In mid-1966, Phillips asked Shea to set up a three-day symposium to
review the status of Apollo. At this 25&ndash;27 June conference, Phillips
requested that the 75 NASA and contractor experts consider carefully
such subjects as command and service module maneuvers, lunar module
descent and ascent, lunar landing sites, and the length of the visit to
the lunar surface.<p>

Shea opened the discussions by listing 23 steps, or rules, in design and
operational philosophy (see accompanying list) that had evolved since
the lunar-orbit rendezvous decision in 1962. Owen Maynard, deliberately
simplifying the many complexities of a lunar mission, described nine
plateaus, of which he said:

<blockquote><p>It is useful to think of the lunar landing mission as being
planned in a series of steps (or decision points) separated by mission
&quot;plateaus.&quot; . . . The decision to continue to the next plateau
is made only after an assessment of the spacecraft's present status and
its ability to function properly on the next plateau. If, after such
assessment, it is determined that the space craft will not be able to
function properly, then the decision may be made to proceed with an
alternative mission. Alternate missions, therefore, will be planned
essentially for each plateau. Similarly, on certain of the plateaus,
including lunar stay, the decision may be made to delay proceeding in
the mission for a period of time. In this respect, the mission is
open-ended and considerable flexibility exists.<a href =
"#source36"><b>36</b></a> </blockquote><p>

These plateaus, representing the amount of energy expended in going from
one step to the next, were widely used by the Apollo engineering team to
map the pathway to the moon's surface and back again. The plateaus were,
logically, (1) prelaunch, (2) earth parking orbit, (3) translunar coast,
(4) lunar orbit before lunar module descent, (5) lunar module descent,
(6) lunar surface stay, (7) lunar module ascent, (8) lunar orbit after
rendezvous, and (9) trans-earth coast. Breaking the journey into these
segments, with identified stopping places, made the Apollo mission seem
less complex and fearsome to the planners.<p>

Near the close of the session, Shea commented that all stages of the
Saturn V were at Kennedy, preparing for a flight test during 1967; that
both the first Block II command and service modules and the lunar module
should fly that same year; and that the time for the first lunar mission
was rapidly closing in. Shea urged everyone at the meeting to review and
comment on current plans and progress.<a href =
"#source37"><b>37</b></a><p>

It was also time to get an active experiments program under way. Mueller
reminded Gilruth that, because of the limitations of 1966&ndash;1967 funding,
NASA should generate as many of the experiments as possible, instead of
relying on contractors. On 14 February 1966, however, Robert O. Piland's
Experiments Program Office (established at MSC in the summer of 1965)
was asked by Homer Newell, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space
Science and Applications, to contract for the development of an Apollo
lunar surface experiments package (ALSEP). The following month, the
Bendix Systems Division of Ann Arbor, Michigan, received a $17-million
contract to produce four ALSEP units. Bendix was a good choice, having
worked with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on experiments for the
unmanned lunar exploration program.<a href =
"#source38"><b>38</b></a><p>

Getting started on what to take to the moon was fine; getting the
facility ready to handle what was brought back from the moon was also
important. Houston had to develop a new kind of facility, the Lunar
Receiving Laboratory. Its two major jobs would be to protect against
back contamination from the moon and to keep the lunar samples as
isolated from earthly pollution as possible. Meeting these quarantine
and control requirements resulted in greater construction costs than
initially estimated, but the Space Science Board of the National Academy
of Sciences had been adamant in its demands that no expense should be
spared:

<blockquote><p>The introduction into Earth's biosphere of destructive alien
organisms could be a disaster of enormous significance to mankind. We
can conceive of no more tragically ironic consequence of our search for
extraterrestrial life.<a href = "#source39"><b>39</b></a>
</blockquote><p>

A conference of experts, sponsored by the board in July 1964, had
reaffirmed the potential hazards of back contamination and recommended
preventive measures. The following year, planning sessions among NASA,
the Public Health Service, the Department of Agriculture, and the Army
Biological Laboratories mapped out a construction plan and set up
precautionary procedures.<p>

Thus, by February 1966, George Low of NASA and James L. Goddard of the
Public Health Service had presented Congress with a case for the
construction of a lunar sample and quarantine facility with six
functions:<p>

<ol>
<li>Microbiology tests of lunar samples to demonstrate to a reasonable
degree of certainty the absence of harmful living organisms returned
from the lunar surface;

<li>Biologically isolated transport of the astronauts and persons
required to have immediate contact with them between the recovery area
and the quarantine facility;

<li>Biological isolation of the astronauts, spacecraft, and other
apparatus having a biologic contamination potential, as well as
personnel required by mission operations to have immediate contact with
these people and this equipment during the quarantine period;

<li>Biological isolation during all operations on the samples that must
be carried out during the quarantine period;

<li>Biologically isolated processing of onboard camera film and data
tape that had been exposed to a potentially contaminating environment;

<li>Performance of time dependent scientific tests where valuable
scientific data would be lost if the tests were delayed for the duration
of the quarantine period.<a href = "#source40"><b>40</b></a>
</ol>

<p>
Shortly after congressional approval of the laboratory, Headquarters
reluctantly agreed that Houston should manage the design and development
of the laboratory without the aid of the Corps of Engineers. Mueller
wrote Gilruth on 13 May 1966 that the facility must be ready by November
1967 at a cost not to exceed $9.1 million. Gilruth and Low established a
policy board, headed by Faget, and placed Joseph V. Piland in charge of
construction. A contract was awarded, ground was broken, and building
began in August.<a href = "#source41"><b>41</b></a><p>

During 1966, planners of Apollo's upcoming operational phase studied the
results of other programs for information that might be useful. Perhaps
the two they scrutinized most carefully were <cite>Gemini VIII,</cite>
which proved that one vehicle could find another in space and safely
dock with it, and <cite>Surveyor I,</cite> which showed that a craft
could land softly on the moon without sinking into the soil - at least
in the area of Oceanus Procellarum.<p>

Neil Armstrong and David Scott rode <cite>Gemini VIII</cite> into orbit
on 16 March to chase an Agena target vehicle already in flight. An
onboard radar acquired the target when the two vehicles were 332
kilometers apart, and the crew members saw the Agena when they were 140
kilometers away. Six hours into the flight, Armstrong and Scott, after
inspecting the Agena closely, nudged the nose of their spacecraft into
the docking cone, recording the first docking of two vehicles in orbit.
Twenty-seven minutes later, Scott's instruments told him that the
spacecraft was not in the planned attitude. The docked vehicles then
began to gyrate. Armstrong steadied the two craft with the thrusters,
and Scott hit the undocking button. Almost immediately, the spacecraft
started spinning at the rate of one revolution per second. Armstrong had
to use the reentry control system<a href = "#explanation1"><b>*</b></a>
to straighten out his vehicle. With the help of the flight controllers
in Houston and along the Manned Space Flight Network, the crew made a
safe emergency landing in the Pacific Ocean - rather than in the
Atlantic, as planned.<a href = "#source42"><b>42</b></a><p>

Even before Gemini had chalked up the world's first docking, the
successful rendezvous of <cite>Gemini VI-A</cite> with <cite>VII</cite>
the previous December had affected the thinking of Apollo mission
designers. The inability of the Saturn IB to toss the command and
service modules and the lunar module into orbit together had forced
planners to consider &quot;LM-alone&quot; flights. Gemini's successful
dual missions suggested that it might be possible to launch a crew
aboard a command module to hunt down a lunar module launched by a
different Saturn IB. Two of the crewmen would then transfer to the
lander and carry out an earth-orbital operation previously planned for a
Saturn V flight.<p>

Although the dual flight for Gemini had been greeted with enthusiasm,
the proposal for an Apollo t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te met with
resistance. John D. Hodge, Kraft's chief lieutenant in the mission
control trenches, said there would be problems in simultaneously
tracking four booster stages and in operating two mission control rooms.
Planning continued, anyway, and Howard Tindall started working up flight
rules - such as which launch vehicle would go first, the one with the
command and service modules (AS-207) or the one with the lunar module
(AS-208). A spate of &quot;Tindallgrams&quot; ensued. By May, Tindall
agreed with Hodge about the complexity of the proposed mission.<a href =
"#source43"><b>43</b></a><p>

While planning proceeded on mission AS-207/208, which seemed to be
gaining favor in Washington, the Soviet Union announced on 4 April that
<cite>Luna 10</cite> was in lunar orbit - a space first. As the Russian
spacecraft sent back information on its voyage around the moon, the
United States made its own unmanned lunar exploration spacecraft ready
for flight. <cite>Surveyor I</cite>, launched by an Atlas-Centaur from
Cape Kennedy on 30 May for a 63-hour trip, was programmed to land softly
on the moon to test bearing strength, temperatures, and radar
reflectivity and to send television pictures back to the earth. With
only slight midcourse corrections, <cite>Surveyor I</cite> flew straight
to its target. On 2 June, the vehicle fired its braking rockets, slowing
its speed from 9,650 kilometers per hour to 640. Four meters above the
surface of the crater Flamstead, it was moving at a mere 5.6 kilometers
per hour. The three footpads touched safely down within 19 milliseconds
of each other.<p>

During the next two weeks, more than 10,000 detailed pictures were
transmitted to the Goldstone antenna and processed at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. They showed rubble scattered over the surface in the Ocean
of Storms region. The Surveyor craft scanned the horizon and sky better
than had been anticipated; its pictures of the stars Sirius and Canopus
gave triangulations for its exact location; and its solar cells, radars,
computers, and test gear all worked well. The craft did not encounter
either hard or porous rock; nor did it find a moon covered by a thick
layer of dust. It landed, instead, on a surface composed of finely
granulated material with particles that adhered to each other and not to
the spacecraft. After all the doubts and waiting, <cite>Surveyor
I</cite> demonstrated that a lunar module could land safely on the moon
and that its pilots could get out and walk on the surface.<a href =

<h2>Major Considerations in the Design of the First Lunar Landing
Mission</h2>

<p>

<ol>
<li>The first Apollo lunar mission will be &quot;open ended,&quot; to
capitalize on success and keep going as long as possible.

<li>Launch will take place on [one of] only three days of any given
month.

<li>Lighting conditions on the moon at the time of arrival will be a
major launch day constraint.

<li>The mission will be flexible enough to land at any one of three
selected landing sites.

<li>Forthcoming information from the first two Orbiters and Surveyor
landers will govern site selection.

<li>The spacecraft will carry the maximum propellants and consumables
that the Saturn V can handle.

<li>A slow roll rate will avoid thermal extremes on the spacecraft.

<li>The Manned Space Flight Network (MSFN) will be the primary source of
navigation data, with onboard navigation as a backup.

<li>The service propulsion system will use the lunar module descent
engine as a backup.

<li>The spacecraft will travel on a free-return trajectory.

<li>Landmark sightings by the onboard systems will reduce uncertainties
about altitude and tie the MSFN to the moon.

<li>Landings will be made in three types of areas - one general and two
specific.

<li>The crew will be integral to the whole mission, particularly in site
selection and landing maneuvers.

<li>The first mission will have an 18-hour staytime and two joint
excursions by the crew.

<li>The LM will use a concentric flight plan for rendezvous with the CSM
after liftoff from the moon.

<li>If necessary, the CSM will be capable of rescuing the LM by
descending to a lower orbit for rendezvous and docking.

<li>The prime recovery zone will be in the Pacific Ocean.

<li>There will be a continuous abort capability throughout the mission.

<li>There will be at least five places during the mission where the
spacecraft can &quot;mark time&quot; to change mission planning in case
of trouble.

<li>Redundant and backup systems will be available for most major
systems; significant exceptions are environmental control, electrical
power, and service propulsion systems.

<li>Continuous communications between spacecraft and ground will be
possible, except when the craft is behind the moon or in a thermal roll
condition.

<li>Design will incorporate reasonable precautions against contamination
of either the earth or the moon

<li>Major concerns still remaining are unforeseen environmental effects,
calibration of guidance and navigation system, means of realistic
simulation of lunar landing under the earth's gravity, and possibility
of overloading crew workload.</ol>
